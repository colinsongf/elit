30	XX

leaving	XX
the	XX

a	XX
response	XX
to	XX

market	XX
situation	XX

But	XX
they	XX
cited	XX
the	XX

''	XX
said	XX

The	XX

have	XX
clearly	XX

can	XX
take	XX

In	XX
general	XX
,	XX
the	XX

give	XX

review	XX

It	XX
also	XX
would	XX
require	XX

acquiring	XX
party	XX
to	XX
notify	XX
the	XX
transportation	XX

to	XX
provide	XX
all	XX
information	XX
relevant	XX
to	XX
determining	XX
the	XX

reject	XX

if	XX
the	XX

weaken	XX

If	XX
more	XX

have	XX
authority	XX

extend	XX

witnesses	XX

both	XX

expressed	XX
support	XX
for	XX
the	XX

to	XX
prevent	XX

Added	XX
another	XX
executive	XX
at	XX
a	XX
big	XX
bank	XX
:	XX
``	XX
We	XX
were	XX
all	XX
a	XX
little	XX
goosey	XX
over	XX
the	XX
weekend	XX
trying	XX
to	XX

would	XX

it	XX

Now	XX
,	XX
as	XX
for	XX
tomorrow	XX

who	XX
knows	XX
?	XX

What	XX
happened	XX
Friday	XX
shows	XX
that	XX
financial	XX
markets	XX
are	XX
not	XX
yet	XX
sufficiently	XX
coordinated	XX
to	XX
handle	XX
another	XX
meltdown	XX
in	XX
prices	XX
.	XX

No	XX
fiddling	XX
with	XX
systems	XX
and	XX
procedures	XX
will	XX
ever	XX
prevent	XX
markets	XX
from	XX
suffering	XX
a	XX
panic	XX
wave	XX
of	XX
selling	XX
.	XX

But	XX
markets	XX
can	XX
operate	XX
with	XX
greater	XX
or	XX
lesser	XX
efficiency	XX
.	XX

After	XX
the	XX
1987	XX
plunge	XX
,	XX
markets	XX
agreed	XX
that	XX
it	XX
would	XX
be	XX
wise	XX
to	XX
halt	XX
trading	XX
whenever	XX
panic	XX
conditions	XX
arose	XX
.	XX

The	XX
New	XX
York	XX
Stock	XX
Exchange	XX
adopted	XX
two	XX
specific	XX
circuit	XX
breakers	XX
:	XX
If	XX
the	XX
Dow	XX
Jones	XX
index	XX
falls	XX
250	XX
points	XX
in	XX
a	XX
day	XX
,	XX
the	XX
exchange	XX
will	XX
halt	XX
trading	XX
for	XX
one	XX
hour	XX
;	XX
if	XX
the	XX
decline	XX
hits	XX
400	XX
points	XX
,	XX
the	XX
exchange	XX
will	XX
close	XX
for	XX
an	XX
additional	XX
two	XX
hours	XX
.	XX

The	XX
rationale	XX
is	XX
that	XX
an	XX
interruption	XX
of	XX
trading	XX
will	XX
allow	XX
investors	XX
to	XX
reconsider	XX
their	XX
strategies	XX
,	XX
calm	XX
sellers	XX
and	XX
lead	XX
buyers	XX
to	XX
enter	XX
the	XX
market	XX
at	XX
indicated	XX
new	XX
price	XX
levels	XX
.	XX

It	XX
is	XX
impossible	XX
to	XX
know	XX
whether	XX
that	XX
theory	XX
is	XX
realistic	XX
.	XX

A	XX
temporary	XX
cessation	XX
of	XX
trading	XX
may	XX
indeed	XX
discourage	XX
a	XX
selling	XX
panic	XX
from	XX
feeding	XX
on	XX
itself	XX
.	XX

But	XX
there	XX
is	XX
also	XX
the	XX
possibility	XX
that	XX
shutting	XX
down	XX
markets	XX
will	XX
intensify	XX
fears	XX
and	XX
cause	XX
an	XX
even	XX
more	XX
abrupt	XX
slide	XX
in	XX
prices	XX
.	XX

What	XX
happened	XX
Friday	XX
was	XX
the	XX
worst	XX
of	XX
all	XX
worlds	XX
.	XX

The	XX
futures	XX
exchanges	XX
followed	XX
their	XX
own	XX
pre-set	XX
circuit	XX
breakers	XX
and	XX
shut	XX
down	XX
at	XX
about	XX
3	XX
p.m.	XX
for	XX
30	XX
minutes	XX
,	XX
after	XX
the	XX
Standard	XX
&	XX
Poor	XX
's	XX
500	XX
stock	XX
index	XX
had	XX
fallen	XX
12	XX
points	XX
,	XX
or	XX
about	XX
100	XX
points	XX
on	XX
the	XX
Dow	XX
Jones	XX
index	XX
.	XX

Options	XX
markets	XX
stopped	XX
trading	XX
in	XX
many	XX
securities	XX
.	XX

The	XX
New	XX
York	XX
Stock	XX
Exchange	XX
,	XX
under	XX
its	XX
own	XX
rules	XX
,	XX
remained	XX
open	XX

With	XX
nowhere	XX
else	XX
to	XX
go	XX
,	XX
sellers	XX
,	XX
and	XX
particularly	XX
program	XX
traders	XX
,	XX
focused	XX
all	XX
their	XX
selling	XX
on	XX
the	XX
New	XX
York	XX
Stock	XX
Exchange	XX
.	XX

As	XX
liquidity	XX
on	XX
that	XX
market	XX
weakened	XX
,	XX
prices	XX
fell	XX
sharply	XX
.	XX

Had	XX
the	XX
futures	XX
and	XX
options	XX
markets	XX
been	XX
open	XX
,	XX
additional	XX
liquidity	XX
would	XX
have	XX
been	XX
provided	XX
and	XX
the	XX
decline	XX
,	XX
most	XX
probably	XX
,	XX
would	XX
have	XX
been	XX
less	XX
intense	XX
.	XX

At	XX
3:30	XX
,	XX
after	XX
intense	XX
telephone	XX
negotiations	XX
between	XX
the	XX
trading	XX
markets	XX
and	XX
Washington	XX
,	XX
the	XX
futures	XX
exchanges	XX
reopened	XX
.	XX

Futures	XX
trading	XX
,	XX
however	XX
,	XX
was	XX
halted	XX
altogether	XX
at	XX
3:45	XX
,	XX
after	XX
the	XX
futures	XX
markets	XX
had	XX
dropped	XX
an	XX
additional	XX
30	XX
points	XX
,	XX
which	XX
is	XX
the	XX
daily	XX
limit	XX
for	XX
price	XX
declines	XX
.	XX

At	XX
this	XX
point	XX
,	XX
the	XX
options	XX
markets	XX
also	XX
shut	XX
down	XX
and	XX
once	XX
more	XX
left	XX
all	XX
sales	XX
to	XX
be	XX
handled	XX
by	XX
the	XX
New	XX
York	XX
Stock	XX
Exchange	XX
.	XX

It	XX
is	XX
time	XX
to	XX
recognize	XX
that	XX
the	XX
New	XX
York	XX
Stock	XX
Exchange	XX
,	XX
the	XX
futures	XX
markets	XX
and	XX
the	XX
options	XX
markets	XX
,	XX
though	XX
physically	XX
separate	XX
,	XX
have	XX
actually	XX
become	XX
so	XX
closely	XX
intertwined	XX
as	XX
to	XX
constitute	XX
one	XX
market	XX
effectively	XX
.	XX

vary	XX
their	XX
strategies	XX
and	XX
execute	XX
their	XX
orders	XX
in	XX
any	XX
one	XX

them	XX
.	XX

It	XX
therefore	XX
makes	XX
no	XX
sense	XX
for	XX
each	XX
market	XX
to	XX
adopt	XX
different	XX
circuit	XX
breakers	XX

maximum	XX

According	XX
to	XX

in	XX

most	XX

leaders	XX
agree	XX
that	XX
talks	XX
should	XX
begin	XX
in	XX
the	XX
second	XX
half	XX
of	XX
1990	XX

will	XX

The	XX
only	XX
strong	XX
opposition	XX
to	XX
changing	XX
the	XX
EC	XX
treaty	XX
comes	XX
from	XX
British	XX
Prime	XX

Margaret	XX

,	XX
who	XX
is	XX
opposed	XX
to	XX
creating	XX
a	XX
single	XX

But	XX
the	XX
process	XX
of	XX
convening	XX
the	XX

does	XX
n't	XX
require	XX
unanimity	XX

Setting	XX
a	XX

to	XX
start	XX
treaty	XX
negotiations	XX
has	XX
no	XX
legal	XX
significance	XX

could	XX
be	XX
viewed	XX

it	XX

the	XX

the	XX
failure	XX

that	XX

everything	XX

We	XX
've	XX
always	XX
thought	XX
that	XX
Mr.	XX

underestimated	XX

vitality	XX

but	XX
maybe	XX
the	XX

starting	XX
to	XX
overwhelm	XX
the	XX
forces	XX
that	XX
made	XX
it	XX
such	XX
a	XX
significant	XX
place	XX
.	XX

What	XX
else	XX
is	XX
one	XX
to	XX
make	XX
of	XX
the	XX
whacky	XX
save-the-earth	XX
initiative	XX
just	XX
proposed	XX
by	XX
several	XX
major	XX
environmental	XX
groups	XX
and	XX
organized	XX
by	XX
the	XX
state	XX
's	XX
attorney	XX
general	XX
?	XX

If	XX
passed	XX
by	XX
the	XX
voters	XX
,	XX
the	XX
recently	XX
announced	XX
initiative	XX
would	XX
phase	XX
out	XX
major	XX
pesticides	XX
,	XX
reduce	XX
carbon	XX

by	XX
40	XX

thought	XX
to	XX
deplete	XX
the	XX

and	XX
create	XX
a	XX
new	XX
state	XX
environmental	XX
officer	XX
armed	XX
with	XX
a	XX
$	XX
40	XX
million	XX
budget	XX
to	XX
sue	XX
any	XX
firm	XX
or	XX
agency	XX
he	XX
thinks	XX
is	XX
being	XX
too	XX
dirty	XX
.	XX

The	XX
initiative	XX
is	XX
based	XX
largely	XX
on	XX
the	XX
wish-lists	XX
of	XX
the	XX
green	XX
lobby	XX
:	XX
the	XX
Sierra	XX
Club	XX
,	XX
the	XX
League	XX
of	XX
Conservation	XX
Voters	XX
,	XX
the	XX
Natural	XX
Resources	XX
Defense	XX
Council	XX
,	XX
the	XX
National	XX
Toxics	XX
Campaign	XX
and	XX
the	XX
Citizens	XX
for	XX
a	XX
Better	XX
Environment	XX
.	XX

Interestingly	XX
,	XX
the	XX
Environmental	XX
Defense	XX
Fund	XX
is	XX
having	XX
nothing	XX
to	XX
do	XX
with	XX
this	XX
one	XX
.	XX

Not	XX
only	XX
Californians	XX
but	XX
all	XX
Americans	XX
would	XX
pay	XX
if	XX
this	XX
thing	XX
passed	XX
.	XX

The	XX
initiative	XX
bars	XX
the	XX
sale	XX
of	XX
any	XX
crops	XX
in	XX
California	XX
that	XX
do	XX
n't	XX
meet	XX
the	XX
initiative	XX
's	XX
standards	XX
.	XX

Kansas	XX
wheat	XX
farmers	XX
and	XX
Florida	XX
fruit	XX
growers	XX
would	XX
have	XX
to	XX
adjust	XX
or	XX
give	XX
up	XX
the	XX
California	XX
market	XX
.	XX

In	XX
other	XX
words	XX
,	XX
California	XX
is	XX
presuming	XX
to	XX
take	XX
control	XX
of	XX
the	XX
nation	XX
's	XX
farm	XX
policy	XX
.	XX

As	XX
usual	XX
the	XX
green	XX
lobby	XX
's	XX
proposal	XX
is	XX
disconnected	XX
from	XX
scientific	XX
reality	XX
.	XX

Consider	XX
the	XX
greenhouse-effect	XX
provision	XX
.	XX

The	XX
proposed	XX
initiative	XX
would	XX
mandate	XX
a	XX
reduction	XX
of	XX
carbon	XX
dioxide	XX
of	XX
40	XX
%	XX
.	XX

Even	XX
if	XX
one	XX
buys	XX
into	XX
the	XX
whole	XX
greenhouse	XX
theory	XX
,	XX
it	XX
is	XX
inconceivable	XX
that	XX
reductions	XX
in	XX
a	XX
single	XX
state	XX
could	XX
have	XX
any	XX
impact	XX
on	XX
what	XX
is	XX
billed	XX
as	XX
a	XX
global	XX
problem	XX
.	XX

But	XX
if	XX
rational	XX
science	XX
and	XX
economics	XX
have	XX
nothing	XX
to	XX
do	XX
with	XX
the	XX
new	XX
environment	XX
initiative	XX
,	XX
what	XX
is	XX
going	XX
on	XX
?	XX

The	XX
first	XX
place	XX
to	XX
look	XX
under	XX
these	XX
circumstances	XX
is	XX
at	XX
the	XX
ways	XX
in	XX
which	XX
the	XX
sponsors	XX
themselves	XX
will	XX
benefit	XX
.	XX

The	XX
key	XX
here	XX
is	XX
the	XX
ambition	XX
of	XX
state	XX
Attorney	XX
General	XX
John	XX
Van	XX
de	XX
Kamp	XX
.	XX

He	XX
's	XX
running	XX
for	XX
governor	XX
.	XX

Mr.	XX
Van	XX
de	XX
Kamp	XX
is	XX
the	XX
one	XX
who	XX
collected	XX
the	XX
plans	XX
from	XX
the	XX
various	XX
radical	XX
environmental	XX
groups	XX
and	XX
cobbled	XX
them	XX
into	XX
a	XX
single	XX
unwieldy	XX
initiative	XX
to	XX
be	XX
placed	XX
on	XX
the	XX
ballot	XX
for	XX
election	XX
on	XX
Nov.	XX
6	XX
,	XX
1990	XX
.	XX

That	XX
's	XX
also	XX
the	XX
day	XX
of	XX
the	XX
gubernatorial	XX
election	XX
.	XX

The	XX
initiative	XX
seems	XX
to	XX
have	XX
been	XX
crafted	XX
to	XX
include	XX
all	XX
the	XX
hot	XX
issues	XX
that	XX
set	XX
off	XX
the	XX
wealthy	XX
Hollywood	XX
weepers	XX
who	XX
donate	XX
money	XX
.	XX

And	XX
it	XX
allows	XX
Mr.	XX
Van	XX
de	XX
Kamp	XX
to	XX
get	XX
around	XX
campaign	XX
spending	XX
limits	XX
.	XX

He	XX
can	XX
spend	XX
the	XX
legal	XX
maximum	XX
for	XX
his	XX
campaign	XX
;	XX
all	XX
the	XX
spending	XX
for	XX
the	XX
Van	XX
de	XX
Kamp	XX
initiative	XX
-LRB-	XX
on	XX
which	XX
there	XX
are	XX
no	XX
limits	XX
-RRB-	XX
is	XX
gravy	XX
.	XX

This	XX
initiative	XX
is	XX
being	XX
labeled	XX
The	XX
Big	XX
Green	XX
,	XX
but	XX
maybe	XX
it	XX
should	XX
be	XX
called	XX
The	XX
Big	XX
Greenback	XX
.	XX

-LRB-	XX
The	XX
Republican	XX
candidate	XX
,	XX
Sen.	XX
Pete	XX
Wilson	XX
,	XX
is	XX
playing	XX
the	XX
initiative	XX
fundraising	XX
game	XX
too	XX
,	XX
sponsoring	XX
his	XX
own	XX
crime	XX
initiative	XX
.	XX
-RRB-	XX

While	XX
it	XX
is	XX
possible	XX
that	XX
the	XX
Big	XX
Green	XX
initiative	XX
will	XX
be	XX
ruled	XX
unconstitutional	XX
,	XX
it	XX
is	XX
of	XX
course	XX
conceivable	XX
that	XX
in	XX
modern	XX
California	XX
it	XX
could	XX
slide	XX
through	XX
.	XX

This	XX
is	XX
the	XX
state	XX
that	XX
recently	XX
passed	XX
the	XX
Prop.	XX
65	XX
anti-toxic	XX
initiative	XX
.	XX

If	XX
this	XX
new	XX
proposal	XX
ever	XX
does	XX
become	XX
law	XX
,	XX
the	XX
green	XX
lobby	XX
will	XX
benefit	XX
directly	XX
.	XX

The	XX
initiative	XX
creates	XX
a	XX
free	XX
floating	XX
state	XX
environmental	XX
officer	XX
to	XX
sue	XX
companies	XX
or	XX
government	XX
agencies	XX
that	XX
do	XX
things	XX
he	XX
does	XX
n't	XX
like	XX
.	XX

That	XX
means	XX
the	XX
NRDC	XX
and	XX
such	XX
groups	XX
no	XX
longer	XX
would	XX
have	XX
to	XX
spend	XX
as	XX
much	XX
money	XX
on	XX
litigation	XX
;	XX
taxpayers	XX
would	XX
bear	XX
the	XX
cost	XX
.	XX

Mr.	XX
Van	XX
de	XX
Kamp	XX
and	XX
his	XX
allies	XX
may	XX
be	XX
hoping	XX
that	XX
the	XX
environment	XX
is	XX
such	XX
a	XX
mom	XX
and	XX
apple-pie	XX
issue	XX
among	XX
certain	XX
segments	XX
of	XX
California	XX
's	XX
population	XX
now	XX
that	XX
almost	XX
any	XX
collection	XX
of	XX
anti-scientific	XX
,	XX
anti-pocketbook	XX
nonsense	XX
can	XX
pass	XX
under	XX
its	XX
rubric	XX
.	XX

Of	XX
course	XX
the	XX
state	XX
's	XX
liberals	XX
are	XX
not	XX
yet	XX
a	XX
nation	XX
unto	XX
themselves	XX
.	XX

George	XX
Bush	XX
,	XX
for	XX
example	XX
,	XX
may	XX
decide	XX
that	XX
he	XX
does	XX
n't	XX
want	XX
to	XX
be	XX
the	XX
President	XX
who	XX
lost	XX
control	XX
of	XX
interstate	XX
commerce	XX
to	XX
an	XX
attorney	XX
general	XX
from	XX
California	XX
.	XX

And	XX
some	XX
other	XX
segments	XX
of	XX
California	XX
's	XX
political	XX
and	XX
media	XX
culture	XX
may	XX
yet	XX
start	XX
to	XX
point	XX
out	XX
that	XX
the	XX
initiative	XX
would	XX
impose	XX
significant	XX
costs	XX
on	XX
the	XX
state	XX
's	XX
less	XX
affluent	XX
citizens	XX
in	XX
the	XX
form	XX
of	XX
higher	XX
food	XX
prices	XX
and	XX
lost	XX
jobs	XX
.	XX

This	XX
grandiose	XX
initiative	XX
will	XX
help	XX
California	XX
define	XX
itself	XX
for	XX
the	XX
future	XX
either	XX
as	XX
a	XX
state	XX
still	XX
tethered	XX
to	XX

or	XX
as	XX

The	XX
rally	XX
gave	XX
credence	XX
,	XX
at	XX

for	XX
now	XX
,	XX
to	XX
the	XX
pre-trading	XX
declaration	XX
of	XX

that	XX

debacle	XX
was	XX
``	XX
an	XX
abnormal	XX
condition	XX

not	XX

disaster	XX

''	XX

But	XX
to	XX

,	XX
it	XX
looked	XX
like	XX
disaster	XX
on	XX
the	XX
9:30	XX
a.m.	XX
opening	XX
bell	XX

The	XX
Dow	XX
Jones	XX

opened	XX
down	XX
1.64	XX
shortly	XX
after	XX

the	XX

the	XX
average	XX
,	XX
including	XX
Eastman	XX
Kodak	XX
and	XX

,	XX
could	XX
n't	XX
trade	XX
because	XX
of	XX
the	XX
heavy	XX
backlog	XX
of	XX
sell	XX
orders	XX
left	XX
over	XX
from	XX
Friday	XX
's	XX
late-afternoon	XX
rout	XX

At	XX
9:45	XX
,	XX
Procter	XX

--	XX

the	XX

opened	XX
down	XX
2	XX
3\/4	XX

117	XX

The	XX
Dow	XX
dropped	XX
to	XX
a	XX
quick	XX
27-point	XX
loss	XX
,	XX
and	XX
to	XX
many	XX
traders	XX
it	XX
looked	XX
as	XX
if	XX
stocks	XX
were	XX
headed	XX
for	XX
yet	XX
another	XX
big	XX
tumble	XX
.	XX

More	XX
stocks	XX
opened	XX
over	XX
the	XX
ensuing	XX
half	XX
hour	XX
,	XX
as	XX
the	XX
49	XX
Big	XX

specialist	XX
firms	XX
in	XX
charge	XX
of	XX
keeping	XX
the	XX
market	XX
orderly	XX
groped	XX

find	XX
buy	XX
orders	XX
from	XX
major	XX

Then	XX
,	XX
to	XX
make	XX
matters	XX
worse	XX
,	XX
computerized	XX
sell	XX
programs	XX
kicked	XX
in	XX
,	XX
hammering	XX
stocks	XX
into	XX
steeper	XX
losses	XX
.	XX

There	XX
was	XX
heavy	XX
stock-index	XX
arbitrage	XX
,	XX
as	XX
traders	XX
sold	XX
big	XX
baskets	XX
of	XX
stock	XX
and	XX
bought	XX
stock-index	XX

to	XX
profit	XX
from	XX
the	XX
price	XX
discrepancies	XX
between	XX
the	XX
two	XX
markets	XX

This	XX
was	XX
a	XX
hangover	XX
from	XX
Friday	XX
,	XX
when	XX
Standard	XX
&	XX
Poor	XX
's	XX
500-stock	XX
index	XX
futures	XX
had	XX
closed	XX
at	XX
a	XX
sharp	XX
discount	XX
to	XX
stocks	XX
.	XX

The	XX
onslaught	XX
of	XX
the	XX
program	XX
selling	XX
dashed	XX
any	XX
hopes	XX
that	XX
some	XX
of	XX
the	XX
big	XX
program	XX
trading	XX
firms	XX
would	XX
hold	XX
off	XX
until	XX
the	XX
market	XX
stabilized	XX
.	XX

They	XX
did	XX
n't	XX
.	XX

The	XX
Dow	XX
accelerated	XX
its	XX
slide	XX
,	XX
losing	XX
63.52	XX
in	XX
the	XX
first	XX
40	XX
minutes	XX
of	XX
trading	XX
.	XX

With	XX
program	XX
traders	XX
seemingly	XX
in	XX
charge	XX
,	XX
buyers	XX
backed	XX
away	XX
from	XX
the	XX
market	XX
and	XX
watched	XX
stocks	XX
fall	XX
.	XX

Then	XX
at	XX
10:15	XX
the	XX
Dow	XX
suddenly	XX
started	XX
to	XX
rebound	XX
,	XX
and	XX
when	XX
it	XX
shot	XX
upward	XX
it	XX
did	XX
so	XX
even	XX
faster	XX
than	XX
the	XX
early-morning	XX
fall	XX
.	XX

And	XX
this	XX
time	XX
,	XX
it	XX
was	XX
n't	XX
just	XX
the	XX
program	XX
traders	XX
who	XX
were	XX
responsible	XX
.	XX

All	XX
the	XX
selling	XX
had	XX
pushed	XX
stocks	XX

such	XX
cheap	XX
values	XX
that	XX
big	XX
investment	XX

and	XX
major	XX
money	XX
management	XX

started	XX
buying	XX
stocks	XX
heavily	XX

The	XX
program	XX
traders	XX
were	XX
in	XX
there	XX
,	XX
too	XX

of	XX
course	XX

But	XX
according	XX
to	XX
one	XX

,	XX

``	XX

n't	XX

A	XX
House-Senate	XX

approved	XX
a	XX

smoking	XX

on	XX
all	XX

on	XX
all	XX

six	XX

The	XX
restrictions	XX
would	XX
cover	XX
all	XX

a	XX
small	XX
percentage	XX
of	XX
domestic	XX

of	XX
the	XX

The	XX
exemption	XX
allowed	XX
on	XX
longer	XX
flights	XX
to	XX
Alaska	XX
and	XX
Hawaii	XX
appears	XX
to	XX
be	XX
largely	XX
a	XX
face-saving	XX
concession	XX
for	XX
the	XX
traditionally	XX
powerful	XX
tobacco	XX
industry	XX

which	XX
has	XX
found	XX
itself	XX
increasingly	XX
isolated	XX
in	XX
the	XX
face	XX
of	XX

pressure	XX
in	XX
recent	XX
years	XX
.	XX

By	XX
a	XX
6-4	XX
margin	XX
,	XX
House	XX
negotiators	XX
initially	XX
rejected	XX
last	XX
night	XX
a	XX
Senate	XX
provision	XX
covering	XX
all	XX
domestic	XX
flights	XX
.	XX

But	XX
the	XX
six-hour	XX
compromise	XX
was	XX
soon	XX
agreed	XX
to	XX
in	XX
subsequent	XX
discussions	XX

As	XX
a	XX
practical	XX
matter	XX
,	XX
flights	XX
from	XX
the	XX
West	XX
Coast	XX

Hawaii	XX
would	XX
be	XX
covered	XX
as	XX
they	XX
are	XX
under	XX

follow	XX

signal	XX

a	XX
commission	XX
charged	XX
with	XX
investigating	XX

analyst	XX
,	XX
Peter	XX
Cardillo	XX
of	XX
Josephthal	XX

,	XX
New	XX

,	XX
said	XX
the	XX
gold	XX
market	XX
already	XX
had	XX
some	XX
good	XX
price-supporting	XX
technical	XX
factors	XX
that	XX
would	XX
have	XX
caused	XX
prices	XX
to	XX
rise	XX
,	XX
with	XX
or	XX
without	XX
the	XX
stock	XX
market	XX
.	XX

``	XX
What	XX
the	XX
stock	XX
market	XX
did	XX
was	XX
cause	XX
the	XX
rise	XX
to	XX
take	XX
place	XX
earlier	XX
than	XX
it	XX
would	XX
have	XX
happened	XX
,	XX
''	XX
said	XX
Mr.	XX
Cardillo	XX
.	XX

There	XX
's	XX
a	XX
good	XX
chance	XX
that	XX
gold	XX
will	XX
retain	XX
its	XX
gains	XX
and	XX
rise	XX
further	XX
,	XX
he	XX
said	XX
.	XX

He	XX
expects	XX
a	XX
drop	XX
in	XX
interest	XX
rates	XX
,	XX
which	XX
would	XX
help	XX
gold	XX
by	XX
keeping	XX
the	XX
dollar	XX
from	XX
rising	XX
.	XX

Finally	XX
,	XX
according	XX
to	XX
Mr.	XX
Cardillo	XX
,	XX
the	XX
impact	XX
of	XX
the	XX
strong	XX
dollar	XX
should	XX
be	XX
reflected	XX
in	XX
reduced	XX
exports	XX
in	XX
the	XX
August	XX
merchandise	XX
trade	XX
deficit	XX
,	XX
when	XX
the	XX
figures	XX
are	XX
released	XX
today	XX
.	XX

This	XX
would	XX
be	XX
damaging	XX
to	XX
the	XX
dollar	XX
and	XX
supportive	XX
for	XX
gold	XX

ENERGY	XX
:	XX

Worried	XX
that	XX
Friday	XX
's	XX
190-point	XX
stock	XX
market	XX
plunge	XX
might	XX
be	XX
a	XX
harbinger	XX
of	XX
things	XX
to	XX
come	XX
for	XX
the	XX
economy	XX
,	XX
petroleum	XX
futures	XX
traders	XX
called	XX
a	XX
halt	XX
to	XX
the	XX
recent	XX
string	XX
of	XX
increases	XX
in	XX
crude	XX
oil	XX
futures	XX
prices	XX
.	XX

The	XX
U.S.	XX
benchmark	XX

closed	XX
at	XX

20.59	XX
a	XX
barrel	XX
for	XX
November	XX
delivery	XX
,	XX
down	XX
30	XX
cents	XX
.	XX

Some	XX
analysts	XX
said	XX
crude	XX
was	XX
due	XX
for	XX
a	XX
correction	XX
anyhow	XX
,	XX
following	XX
several	XX
days	XX
of	XX
significant	XX
gains	XX
.	XX

But	XX
most	XX
market	XX
observers	XX
agreed	XX
that	XX
Friday	XX
's	XX
stock	XX
market	XX
drop	XX
is	XX
what	XX
dampened	XX
spirits	XX
in	XX
the	XX
petroleum	XX
pits	XX
yesterday	XX
.	XX

Until	XX
yesterday	XX
,	XX
futures	XX
prices	XX
had	XX
been	XX
headed	XX
up	XX
on	XX
expectations	XX
that	XX
world	XX
oil	XX
demand	XX
will	XX
continue	XX
to	XX
be	XX
strong	XX
.	XX

The	XX
Organization	XX
of	XX
Petroleum	XX
Exporting	XX
Countries	XX
increased	XX
its	XX
production	XX
ceiling	XX
for	XX
the	XX
fourth	XX
quarter	XX
based	XX
on	XX
projections	XX
of	XX
robust	XX
demand	XX
.	XX

So	XX
any	XX
bearish	XX
indicator	XX
,	XX
such	XX
as	XX
Friday	XX
's	XX
precipitous	XX
drop	XX
in	XX
the	XX
stock	XX
market	XX
,	XX
sends	XX
shivers	XX
through	XX
the	XX
oil	XX
markets	XX
as	XX
well	XX
.	XX

Indeed	XX
,	XX
after	XX
reacting	XX
early	XX
in	XX
the	XX
trading	XX
day	XX
to	XX
Friday	XX
's	XX
plummet	XX
,	XX
futures	XX
prices	XX
firmed	XX
up	XX
again	XX
as	XX

partial	XX
recovery	XX
yesterday	XX

were	XX
down	XX

the	XX

sweep	XX
the	XX

investors	XX
large	XX

small	XX
seemed	XX
to	XX
accept	XX
Friday	XX

dizzying	XX
190-point	XX
plunge	XX
as	XX
a	XX
sharp	XX
correction	XX
,	XX
not	XX
a	XX
calamity	XX

Many	XX
went	XX
bargain-hunting	XX

was	XX
John	XX

monitor	XX
yesterday	XX

Big	XX

stocks	XX
of	XX
many	XX
of	XX
the	XX
nation	XX
's	XX
biggest	XX
companies	XX
could	XX
n't	XX
open	XX
for	XX

because	XX
a	XX
wave	XX
of	XX
sell	XX
orders	XX
was	XX
overwhelming	XX
buyers	XX
.	XX

By	XX
10:10	XX
,	XX
the	XX
Dow	XX
Industrials	XX
were	XX
off	XX
63.52	XX

the	XX
stock	XX

UAL	XX

,	XX
whose	XX

had	XX
kicked	XX
off	XX
Friday	XX

But	XX
then	XX
,	XX
as	XX
quickly	XX
as	XX
the	XX
Dow	XX
had	XX
fallen	XX
,	XX
it	XX
began	XX
to	XX
turn	XX
around	XX
.	XX

It	XX
ended	XX
with	XX
a	XX
gain	XX
of	XX
88.12	XX
points	XX

the	XX
market	XX

volume	XX
on	XX
the	XX

totaled	XX
more	XX

416	XX
million	XX

the	XX
fourth	XX
highest	XX
on	XX

The	XX
Big	XX

handled	XX
the	XX
huge	XX
volume	XX
without	XX
any	XX
obvious	XX
strain	XX
,	XX
in	XX
sharp	XX
contrast	XX
to	XX
Black	XX
Monday	XX
of	XX
1987	XX
.	XX

But	XX
the	XX
rally	XX
was	XX
largely	XX
confined	XX
to	XX
the	XX
blue-chip	XX
stocks	XX
,	XX
which	XX
had	XX
been	XX
hard	XX
hit	XX
during	XX
Friday	XX

Friday	XX

Many	XX
other	XX
factors	XX
played	XX
a	XX
part	XX
in	XX
yesterday	XX
's	XX
comeback	XX
.	XX

The	XX
Federal	XX
Reserve	XX
signaled	XX
its	XX
willingness	XX
to	XX
provide	XX
liquidity	XX
;	XX
the	XX
interest	XX
rate	XX
on	XX
its	XX
loans	XX
to	XX
major	XX
banks	XX
inched	XX
downward	XX
early	XX
in	XX
the	XX
day	XX
.	XX

Foreign	XX
stock	XX
markets	XX
,	XX
which	XX
kicked	XX
off	XX
Black	XX
Monday	XX
with	XX
a	XX
huge	XX
selling	XX
spree	XX
,	XX
began	XX
the	XX
day	XX
off	XX
by	XX
relatively	XX
modest	XX
amounts	XX
.	XX

The	XX
dollar	XX
,	XX
after	XX
falling	XX
sharply	XX
in	XX
overnight	XX
trading	XX
to	XX
139.10	XX
yen	XX
,	XX
bounced	XX
back	XX
strongly	XX
to	XX
141.8	XX
,	XX
thus	XX
easing	XX
fears	XX
that	XX
foreigners	XX
would	XX
unload	XX
U.S.	XX
stocks	XX
.	XX

And	XX
the	XX
widely	XX
disseminated	XX
opinion	XX
among	XX
most	XX
market	XX
experts	XX
that	XX
a	XX
crash	XX
was	XX
n't	XX
in	XX
store	XX
also	XX
helped	XX
calm	XX
investors	XX
.	XX

Many	XX
major	XX
institutions	XX
,	XX
for	XX
example	XX
,	XX
came	XX
into	XX
work	XX
yesterday	XX
ready	XX
to	XX
buy	XX
some	XX
of	XX
the	XX
blue	XX
chips	XX
they	XX
felt	XX
had	XX
been	XX
sharply	XX
undervalued	XX
on	XX
Friday	XX
.	XX

Still	XX
,	XX
amid	XX
all	XX
the	XX
backslapping	XX
and	XX
signs	XX
of	XX
relief	XX
over	XX
yesterday	XX
's	XX
events	XX
,	XX
some	XX
market	XX
professionals	XX
cautioned	XX
that	XX
there	XX
is	XX
nothing	XX
present	XX
in	XX
the	XX
current	XX
market	XX
system	XX
to	XX
prevent	XX
another	XX
dizzying	XX
drop	XX
such	XX
as	XX
Friday	XX
's	XX
.	XX

``	XX
There	XX
is	XX
too	XX
much	XX
complacency	XX

''	XX

manager	XX
Barry	XX
Schrager	XX
.	XX

Computers	XX
have	XX
increasingly	XX
connected	XX
securities	XX
markets	XX
world-wide	XX
,	XX
so	XX
that	XX
a	XX
buying	XX
or	XX
selling	XX
wave	XX
in	XX
one	XX
market	XX
is	XX
often	XX
passed	XX
around	XX
the	XX
globe	XX
.	XX

So	XX
investors	XX
everywhere	XX
nervously	XX
eyed	XX
yesterday	XX
's	XX
opening	XX
in	XX
Tokyo	XX
,	XX
where	XX
the	XX
Nikkei	XX
average	XX
of	XX
225	XX
blue-chip	XX
stocks	XX
got	XX
off	XX
to	XX
a	XX
rocky	XX
start	XX
.	XX

The	XX
average	XX
plunged	XX
some	XX
600	XX
points	XX
,	XX
or	XX
1.7	XX
%	XX
,	XX
in	XX
the	XX
first	XX
20	XX
minutes	XX
of	XX
trading	XX
.	XX

But	XX
the	XX
selling	XX
wave	XX
had	XX
no	XX
conviction	XX
,	XX
and	XX
the	XX
market	XX
first	XX
surged	XX
upward	XX
by	XX
200	XX
points	XX
,	XX
then	XX
drifted	XX
lower	XX
,	XX
closing	XX
down	XX
647	XX
.	XX

Unlike	XX
two	XX
years	XX
ago	XX
,	XX
most	XX
of	XX
Japan	XX
's	XX
major	XX
investors	XX
chose	XX
to	XX

Quantum	XX
's	XX
lot	XX
is	XX
mostly	XX
tied	XX
to	XX

In	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX
polyethylene	XX
market	XX
,	XX
Quantum	XX
has	XX
claimed	XX
the	XX
largest	XX
share	XX
,	XX
about	XX
20	XX
%	XX

But	XX
its	XX
competitors	XX
--	XX

Dow	XX
Chemical	XX

Corp.	XX
and	XX
several	XX

giants	XX
--	XX
have	XX
much	XX
broader	XX
business	XX
interests	XX
and	XX
so	XX
are	XX
better	XX
cushioned	XX
against	XX
price	XX
swings	XX
.	XX

When	XX
the	XX
price	XX
of	XX
polyethylene	XX
moves	XX
a	XX
mere	XX
penny	XX
a	XX
pound	XX
,	XX
Quantum	XX
's	XX
annual	XX
profit	XX
fluctuates	XX
by	XX
about	XX
85	XX
cents	XX
a	XX
share	XX
,	XX
provided	XX
no	XX
other	XX
variables	XX
are	XX
changing	XX

In	XX
recent	XX
months	XX
the	XX
price	XX
of	XX
polyethylene	XX
,	XX
even	XX
more	XX
than	XX
that	XX
of	XX
other	XX
commodity	XX
plastics	XX
,	XX
has	XX
taken	XX
a	XX
dive	XX

Benchmark	XX

50	XX

spring	XX

skidded	XX
to	XX
between	XX
35	XX
cents	XX

40	XX
cents	XX

Meanwhile	XX
,	XX
the	XX
price	XX
of	XX
ethylene	XX
,	XX
the	XX
chemical	XX
building	XX
block	XX
of	XX
polyethylene	XX
,	XX
has	XX
n't	XX
dropped	XX
nearly	XX
so	XX
fast	XX
.	XX

That	XX
discrepancy	XX
hurts	XX
Quantum	XX
badly	XX
,	XX
because	XX
its	XX
own	XX
plants	XX
cover	XX
only	XX
about	XX
half	XX
of	XX
its	XX
ethylene	XX
needs	XX
.	XX

By	XX

accounts	XX
,	XX

early	XX
hint	XX

had	XX
been	XX
putting	XX
in	XX
huge	XX
orders	XX
for	XX
polyethylene	XX
,	XX
abruptly	XX
halted	XX
them	XX

Calculating	XX
that	XX
excess	XX
polyethylene	XX
would	XX
soon	XX
be	XX
sloshing	XX
around	XX
the	XX
world	XX
,	XX
other	XX
buyers	XX
then	XX
bet	XX
that	XX
prices	XX
had	XX
peaked	XX
and	XX
so	XX
began	XX
to	XX
draw	XX
down	XX
inventories	XX
rather	XX
than	XX
order	XX
new	XX
product	XX

Kenneth	XX
Mitchell	XX
,	XX
director	XX
of	XX
Dow	XX
's	XX
polyethylene	XX
business	XX

says	XX
producers	XX
were	XX
surprised	XX
to	XX
learn	XX
how	XX
much	XX

had	XX
swelled	XX
throughout	XX
the	XX
distribution	XX

as	XX
prices	XX
spiraled	XX
up	XX

``	XX
People	XX

Now	XX

hit	XX

They	XX
recently	XX
announced	XX
increases	XX

few	XX
cents	XX

take	XX

in	XX
the	XX
next	XX

No	XX
one	XX
knows	XX

whether	XX
the	XX

will	XX
stick	XX
once	XX

described	XX
the	XX

a	XX
way	XX
for	XX
it	XX
to	XX
share	XX
the	XX

because	XX

saw	XX

an	XX
effort	XX

Mr.	XX

confronts	XX
a	XX
disaster	XX

After	XX
an	XX
explosion	XX
idled	XX

in	XX
June	XX

in	XX

12	XX
hours	XX

completing	XX
the	XX
drawn-out	XX
process	XX

Then	XX
a	XX
second	XX
explosion	XX
occurred	XX

Two	XX
workers	XX
died	XX
and	XX
six	XX
remain	XX
in	XX
the	XX
hospital	XX

This	XX
human	XX
toll	XX
adds	XX
the	XX
most	XX
painful	XX
dimension	XX

to	XX
the	XX
sudden	XX
change	XX
in	XX

Until	XX
this	XX

steadily	XX
lowering	XX
its	XX
accident	XX
rate	XX

picking	XX
up	XX
trade-group	XX

A	XX
prolonged	XX
production	XX
halt	XX
at	XX
the	XX
plant	XX
could	XX
introduce	XX
another	XX
imponderable	XX
into	XX

When	XX

just	XX
been	XX
running	XX
flat	XX
out	XX

meet	XX
demand	XX
,	XX
calculating	XX
lost	XX
profit	XX
and	XX
thus	XX
claims	XX

business-interruption	XX

straightforward	XX

the	XX

trickier	XX

dickering	XX

it	XX
is	XX
n't	XX
always	XX
easy	XX
to	XX
persuade	XX
consumers	XX
that	XX
less	XX
is	XX
more	XX
;	XX
many	XX
people	XX
tend	XX
to	XX
dump	XX
too	XX
much	XX
detergent	XX
into	XX
the	XX
washing	XX
machine	XX
,	XX
believing	XX
that	XX
it	XX
takes	XX
a	XX
cup	XX
of	XX

to	XX
really	XX
clean	XX
the	XX
laundry	XX
.	XX

In	XX
the	XX
early	XX
1980s	XX
,	XX
P&G	XX
tried	XX
to	XX
launch	XX
here	XX
a	XX
concentrated	XX
detergent	XX
under	XX
the	XX
Ariel	XX
brand	XX
name	XX
that	XX
it	XX
markets	XX
in	XX
Europe	XX
.	XX

But	XX
the	XX
product	XX
,	XX
which	XX
was	XX
n't	XX
as	XX
concentrated	XX
as	XX
the	XX
new	XX
Cheer	XX
,	XX
bombed	XX
in	XX
a	XX
market	XX
test	XX
in	XX
Denver	XX
and	XX
was	XX
dropped	XX
.	XX

P&G	XX
and	XX
others	XX
also	XX
have	XX
tried	XX
repeatedly	XX
to	XX
hook	XX
consumers	XX
on	XX
detergent	XX
and	XX
fabric	XX
softener	XX
combinations	XX
in	XX
pouches	XX
,	XX
but	XX
they	XX
have	XX
n't	XX
sold	XX
well	XX
,	XX
despite	XX
the	XX
convenience	XX
.	XX

But	XX
P&G	XX
contends	XX
the	XX
new	XX
Cheer	XX
is	XX
a	XX
unique	XX
formula	XX
that	XX
also	XX
offers	XX
an	XX
ingredient	XX
that	XX
prevents	XX
colors	XX
from	XX
fading	XX
.	XX

And	XX
retailers	XX
are	XX
expected	XX
to	XX
embrace	XX
the	XX
product	XX
,	XX
in	XX
part	XX
because	XX
it	XX
will	XX
take	XX
up	XX
less	XX
shelf	XX

``	XX
When	XX
shelf	XX
space	XX
was	XX
cheap	XX

''	XX
says	XX
Hugh	XX
Zurkuhlen	XX
,	XX
an	XX
analyst	XX
at	XX
Salomon	XX

But	XX
with	XX
so	XX
many	XX
brands	XX
vying	XX
for	XX
space	XX
,	XX
that	XX
's	XX
no	XX
longer	XX
the	XX
case	XX

If	XX
the	XX
new	XX
Cheer	XX
sells	XX
well	XX
,	XX
the	XX
trend	XX
toward	XX
smaller	XX
packaging	XX
is	XX
likely	XX
to	XX
accelerate	XX
as	XX
competitors	XX
follow	XX
with	XX
their	XX
own	XX
superconcentrates	XX
.	XX

Then	XX
retailers	XX
``	XX

probably	XX
push	XX

out	XX

about	XX
23	XX

have	XX
said	XX
they	XX
are	XX
interested	XX
in	XX
selling	XX
detergents	XX
in	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX

but	XX
so	XX

the	XX
company	XX

focused	XX
on	XX

It	XX
also	XX

Some	XX
believe	XX
P&G	XX

in	XX
a	XX

goes	XX
beyond	XX
the	XX

With	XX
economic	XX
tension	XX
between	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX

Japan	XX
worsening	XX
,	XX
many	XX
Japanese	XX
had	XX
feared	XX
last	XX
week	XX
's	XX
visit	XX
from	XX
U.S.	XX
Trade	XX
Representative	XX
Carla	XX
Hills	XX
.	XX

They	XX
expected	XX
a	XX
new	XX
barrage	XX
of	XX
demands	XX
that	XX
Japan	XX
do	XX
something	XX
quickly	XX
to	XX
reduce	XX
its	XX
trade	XX
surplus	XX
with	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX
.	XX

Instead	XX
,	XX
they	XX
got	XX
a	XX
discussion	XX
of	XX
the	XX
need	XX
for	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX
and	XX
Japan	XX
to	XX
work	XX
together	XX
and	XX
of	XX
the	XX
importance	XX
of	XX
the	XX
long-term	XX
view	XX

Mrs.	XX
Hills	XX
'	XX
first	XX
trip	XX
to	XX
Japan	XX
as	XX
America	XX
's	XX
chief	XX
trade	XX
negotiator	XX
had	XX
a	XX
completely	XX
different	XX
tone	XX
from	XX
last	XX
month	XX
's	XX
visit	XX
by	XX
Commerce	XX
Secretary	XX
Robert	XX
A.	XX
Mosbacher	XX
.	XX

Mr.	XX
Mosbacher	XX
called	XX
for	XX
concrete	XX
results	XX
by	XX
next	XX
spring	XX
in	XX
negotiations	XX
over	XX
fundamental	XX
Japanese	XX
business	XX
practices	XX
that	XX
supposedly	XX
inhibit	XX
free	XX
trade	XX
.	XX

He	XX
said	XX
such	XX
results	XX
should	XX
be	XX
``	XX
measurable	XX
in	XX
dollars	XX
and	XX
cents	XX
''	XX
in	XX
reducing	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX
trade	XX
deficit	XX
with	XX
Japan	XX
.	XX

But	XX
Mrs.	XX
Hills	XX
,	XX
speaking	XX
at	XX
a	XX
breakfast	XX
meeting	XX
of	XX
the	XX
American	XX
Chamber	XX
of	XX
Commerce	XX
in	XX
Japan	XX
on	XX
Saturday	XX
,	XX
stressed	XX
that	XX
the	XX
objective	XX
``	XX
is	XX
not	XX
to	XX
get	XX
definitive	XX
action	XX
by	XX
spring	XX
or	XX
summer	XX
,	XX
it	XX
is	XX
rather	XX
to	XX
have	XX
a	XX
blueprint	XX
for	XX
action	XX
.	XX
''	XX

She	XX
added	XX
that	XX
she	XX
expected	XX
``	XX
perhaps	XX
to	XX
have	XX
a	XX
down	XX
payment	XX
...	XX
some	XX
small	XX
step	XX
to	XX
convince	XX
the	XX
American	XX
people	XX
and	XX
the	XX
Japanese	XX
people	XX
that	XX
we	XX
're	XX
moving	XX
in	XX
earnest	XX

''	XX

How	XX
such	XX
remarks	XX
translate	XX
into	XX
policy	XX
wo	XX
n't	XX
become	XX
clear	XX
for	XX
months	XX
.	XX

American	XX
and	XX
Japanese	XX
officials	XX
offered	XX
several	XX
theories	XX
for	XX
the	XX
difference	XX
in	XX
approach	XX
betwen	XX
Mr.	XX
Mosbacher	XX
and	XX
Mrs.	XX
Hills	XX
.	XX

Many	XX
called	XX
it	XX
simply	XX
a	XX
contrast	XX
in	XX
styles	XX
.	XX

But	XX
some	XX
saw	XX
it	XX
as	XX
a	XX
classic	XX
negotiating	XX
tactic	XX
.	XX

Others	XX
said	XX
the	XX
Bush	XX
administration	XX
may	XX
feel	XX
the	XX
rhetoric	XX
on	XX
both	XX
sides	XX
is	XX
getting	XX
out	XX
of	XX
hand	XX
.	XX

And	XX
some	XX
said	XX
it	XX
reflected	XX
the	XX
growing	XX
debate	XX
in	XX
Washington	XX
over	XX
pursuing	XX
free	XX
trade	XX
with	XX
Japan	XX
versus	XX
some	XX
kind	XX
of	XX
managed	XX
trade	XX
.	XX

Asked	XX
to	XX
compare	XX
her	XX
visit	XX
to	XX
Mr.	XX
Mosbacher	XX
's	XX
,	XX
Mrs.	XX
Hills	XX
replied	XX
:	XX
``	XX
I	XX
did	XX
n't	XX

Yet	XX
more	XX
than	XX
one	XX
American	XX

who	XX
sat	XX
in	XX
with	XX
her	XX
during	XX
three	XX
days	XX
of	XX
talks	XX
with	XX
Japanese	XX
officials	XX
said	XX
her	XX
tone	XX
often	XX
was	XX
surprisingly	XX
``	XX
conciliatory	XX

''	XX

``	XX
I	XX
think	XX
my	XX
line	XX
has	XX
been	XX
very	XX

Mrs.	XX

said	XX
at	XX
a	XX
news	XX
conference	XX
Saturday	XX
afternoon	XX
.	XX

``	XX
I	XX
am	XX
painted	XX
sometimes	XX
as	XX

I	XX
do	XX

very	XX
ferocious	XX

I	XX
do	XX
n't	XX
feel	XX
either	XX

local	XX
press	XX
for	XX
the	XX
first	XX
time	XX
on	XX
Friday	XX

Mrs.	XX
Hills	XX
firmly	XX
reiterated	XX
the	XX
need	XX
for	XX
progress	XX

removing	XX
barriers	XX
to	XX
trade	XX
in	XX
forest	XX
products	XX
,	XX
satellites	XX

under	XX
the	XX
Super	XX
301	XX
provision	XX
of	XX
the	XX
1988	XX
trade	XX
bill	XX

She	XX
highlighted	XX
exclusionary	XX
business	XX
practices	XX
that	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX
government	XX
has	XX
identified	XX
.	XX

But	XX
her	XX
main	XX
thrust	XX
was	XX
to	XX
promote	XX
the	XX
importance	XX
of	XX
world-wide	XX
free	XX
trade	XX
and	XX
open	XX
competition	XX
.	XX

She	XX
said	XX
the	XX
trade	XX
imbalance	XX
was	XX
mainly	XX
due	XX
to	XX
macroeconomic	XX
factors	XX
and	XX
should	XX
n't	XX
be	XX
tackled	XX
by	XX
setting	XX
quantitative	XX
targets	XX
.	XX

At	XX
her	XX
news	XX
conference	XX
for	XX
Japanese	XX
reporters	XX
,	XX
one	XX
economics	XX
journalist	XX
summed	XX
up	XX
the	XX
Japanese	XX
sense	XX
of	XX
relief	XX

``	XX
My	XX
impression	XX
was	XX
that	XX
you	XX
would	XX
be	XX
a	XX

said	XX

a	XX
few	XX
nervous	XX
chuckles	XX
from	XX
his	XX

Mrs.	XX

'	XX
remarks	XX
did	XX
raise	XX
questions	XX
,	XX
at	XX

among	XX
some	XX
U.S.	XX
officials	XX

about	XX
what	XX
exactly	XX
her	XX

the	XX
Japanese	XX
semiconductor	XX
market	XX

has	XX
been	XX
stuck	XX
around	XX
10	XX
%	XX
for	XX
years	XX

Many	XX
Americans	XX
have	XX
interpreted	XX
a	XX

assuring	XX

a	XX
20	XX

the	XX

effectively	XX
signed	XX

notices	XX

cast	XX
serious	XX
doubt	XX

the	XX
futures	XX
of	XX

GM	XX
is	XX
under	XX
intense	XX
pressure	XX
to	XX
close	XX
factories	XX
that	XX
became	XX
unprofitable	XX
as	XX
the	XX
giant	XX
auto	XX
maker	XX
's	XX
U.S.	XX
market	XX

The	XX
company	XX

currently	XX
using	XX
about	XX
80	XX
%	XX
of	XX
its	XX
North	XX
American	XX
vehicle	XX

has	XX
vowed	XX
it	XX
will	XX
run	XX

by	XX
1992	XX

Just	XX
a	XX
month	XX
ago	XX
,	XX
GM	XX
announced	XX
it	XX
would	XX
make	XX
an	XX
aging	XX
assembly	XX
plant	XX
in	XX
Lakewood	XX
,	XX
Ga.	XX
,	XX
the	XX
eighth	XX
U.S.	XX
assembly	XX
facility	XX
to	XX
close	XX
since	XX
1987	XX

Now	XX
,	XX
GM	XX
appears	XX
to	XX
be	XX
stepping	XX
up	XX
the	XX
pace	XX
of	XX
its	XX
factory	XX
consolidation	XX
to	XX
get	XX
in	XX
shape	XX
for	XX
the	XX
1990s	XX
.	XX

One	XX
reason	XX
is	XX
mounting	XX
competition	XX
from	XX
new	XX
Japanese	XX
car	XX
plants	XX
in	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX
that	XX
are	XX
pouring	XX
out	XX
more	XX
than	XX
one	XX
million	XX
vehicles	XX
a	XX
year	XX
at	XX
costs	XX
lower	XX
than	XX
GM	XX
can	XX
match	XX
.	XX

Another	XX
is	XX
that	XX
United	XX
Auto	XX
Workers	XX
union	XX
officials	XX
have	XX
signaled	XX
they	XX
want	XX
tighter	XX
no-layoff	XX
provisions	XX

new	XX
Big	XX
Three	XX
national	XX
contract	XX
that	XX
will	XX
be	XX

next	XX
year	XX

GM	XX
officials	XX
want	XX
to	XX
get	XX
their	XX
strategy	XX
to	XX
reduce	XX
capacity	XX
and	XX
the	XX
work	XX
force	XX
in	XX
place	XX
before	XX
those	XX
talks	XX
begin	XX
.	XX

The	XX
problem	XX
,	XX
however	XX
,	XX
is	XX
that	XX
GM	XX
's	XX
moves	XX
are	XX
coming	XX
at	XX
a	XX
time	XX
when	XX
UAW	XX
leaders	XX

When	XX
Justice	XX
William	XX

marks	XX
the	XX
start	XX
of	XX
his	XX
34th	XX
year	XX
on	XX
the	XX
Supreme	XX
Court	XX
today	XX
,	XX
the	XX
occasion	XX
will	XX
differ	XX
sharply	XX
from	XX
previous	XX
anniversaries	XX
of	XX
his	XX
tenure	XX
.	XX

For	XX
the	XX
first	XX
time	XX
,	XX
the	XX
83-year-old	XX
justice	XX
finds	XX
his	XX
influence	XX
almost	XX
exclusively	XX
in	XX
dissent	XX
,	XX
rather	XX
than	XX
as	XX
a	XX
force	XX
in	XX
the	XX
high	XX
court	XX
's	XX
majority	XX
.	XX

This	XX
role	XX
reversal	XX
holds	XX
true	XX
,	XX
as	XX
well	XX
,	XX
for	XX
his	XX
three	XX
liberal	XX
and	XX
moderate	XX
allies	XX
,	XX
Justices	XX
Thurgood	XX
Marshall	XX
,	XX
Harry	XX
Blackmun	XX
and	XX
John	XX
Stevens	XX
.	XX

But	XX
are	XX
these	XX
four	XX
players	XX
,	XX
three	XX
of	XX
them	XX
in	XX
their	XX
80s	XX
,	XX
ready	XX
to	XX
assume	XX
a	XX
different	XX
role	XX
after	XX
88	XX
years	XX
,	XX
collectively	XX
,	XX
of	XX
service	XX
on	XX
the	XX
high	XX
court	XX
?	XX

Every	XX
indication	XX
is	XX
that	XX
the	XX
four	XX
are	XX
prepared	XX
to	XX
accept	XX
this	XX
new	XX
role	XX
,	XX
and	XX
the	XX
frustrations	XX
that	XX
go	XX
with	XX
it	XX
,	XX
but	XX
in	XX
different	XX
ways	XX
.	XX

Justices	XX
Brennan	XX
and	XX
Stevens	XX
appear	XX
philosophical	XX
about	XX
it	XX
;	XX
Justices	XX
Marshall	XX
and	XX
Blackmun	XX
appear	XX
fighting	XX
mad	XX
.	XX

The	XX
four	XX
justices	XX
are	XX
no	XX
newcomers	XX
to	XX
dissent	XX
,	XX
often	XX
joining	XX
forces	XX
in	XX
the	XX
past	XX
decade	XX
to	XX
criticize	XX
the	XX
court	XX
's	XX
conservative	XX
drift	XX
.	XX

But	XX
always	XX
,	XX
in	XX
years	XX
past	XX
,	XX
they	XX
have	XX
bucked	XX
the	XX
trend	XX
and	XX
have	XX
been	XX
able	XX
to	XX
pick	XX
up	XX
a	XX
fifth	XX
vote	XX
to	XX
eke	XX
out	XX
a	XX
number	XX
of	XX
major	XX
victories	XX
in	XX
civil	XX
rights	XX
and	XX
liberties	XX
cases	XX
.	XX

Now	XX
,	XX
however	XX
,	XX
as	XX
the	XX
court	XX
's	XX
new	XX
five-member	XX
conservative	XX
majority	XX
continues	XX
to	XX
solidify	XX
,	XX
victories	XX
for	XX
the	XX
liberals	XX
are	XX
rare	XX
.	XX

The	XX
change	XX
is	XX
most	XX
dramatic	XX
for	XX
Justice	XX
Brennan	XX
,	XX
the	XX
last	XX
survivor	XX
of	XX
the	XX
mid-1960s	XX
liberal	XX
majority	XX
under	XX
Chief	XX
Justice	XX
Earl	XX
Warren	XX
.	XX

In	XX
the	XX
seven	XX

only	XX

Justice	XX

foresaw	XX
his	XX
new	XX
role	XX

strongly	XX

importance	XX
of	XX

was	XX
on	XX

Associates	XX
of	XX
81-year-old	XX

is	XX
feisty	XX

will	XX
turn	XX

next	XX
month	XX
,	XX
also	XX
seems	XX
feisty	XX
about	XX
his	XX

Associates	XX
say	XX
he	XX
takes	XX
some	XX
defeats	XX
more	XX
personally	XX
than	XX

associates	XX
who	XX
saw	XX

during	XX

was	XX
no	XX

his	XX
outlook	XX
improved	XX
after	XX

But	XX
his	XX
level	XX
of	XX

showed	XX
in	XX

concluded	XX

Justice	XX
Stevens	XX
,	XX
69	XX

is	XX
probably	XX
the	XX
most	XX
philosophical	XX
of	XX
the	XX
dissenters	XX
about	XX
his	XX
role	XX
,	XX
in	XX
part	XX
because	XX
he	XX
may	XX
be	XX
the	XX
least	XX
liberal	XX
of	XX
the	XX
four	XX

also	XX
because	XX
he	XX
enjoys	XX
the	XX

with	XX
the	XX

more	XX
than	XX
the	XX

If	XX
the	XX

In	XX

CenTrust	XX
added	XX
$	XX
22.5	XX
million	XX
to	XX
its	XX
general	XX
reserves	XX
.	XX

Mr.	XX
Paul	XX
said	XX
the	XX
regulators	XX
should	XX
instead	XX
move	XX
ahead	XX
with	XX
approving	XX
CenTrust	XX
's	XX
request	XX
to	XX
sell	XX
63	XX
of	XX
its	XX
71	XX

based	XX

.	XX

The	XX
branch	XX
sale	XX
is	XX
the	XX
centerpiece	XX
of	XX
CenTrust	XX
's	XX
strategy	XX
to	XX
transform	XX
itself	XX
into	XX
a	XX
traditional	XX
S&L	XX
from	XX
a	XX
high-flying	XX
institution	XX
that	XX
relied	XX
heavily	XX
on	XX
securities	XX
trading	XX
for	XX
profits	XX
,	XX
according	XX
to	XX
Mr.	XX
Paul	XX
.	XX

Most	XX
analysts	XX
and	XX
thrift	XX
executives	XX
had	XX
expected	XX
a	XX
decision	XX
on	XX
the	XX
proposed	XX
transaction	XX
,	XX
which	XX
was	XX
announced	XX
in	XX
July	XX
,	XX
long	XX
before	XX
now	XX
.	XX

Many	XX
interpret	XX
the	XX
delay	XX
as	XX
an	XX
indication	XX
that	XX
regulators	XX
are	XX
skeptical	XX
about	XX
the	XX
proposal	XX
.	XX

Branches	XX
and	XX
deposits	XX
can	XX
be	XX
sold	XX
at	XX
a	XX
premium	XX
in	XX
the	XX
event	XX
federal	XX
regulators	XX
take	XX
over	XX
an	XX
institution	XX
.	XX

CenTrust	XX
,	XX
however	XX
,	XX
touts	XX
the	XX
branch	XX
sale	XX
,	XX
saying	XX
it	XX
would	XX
bring	XX
in	XX
$	XX
150	XX
million	XX
and	XX
reduce	XX
the	XX
thrift	XX
's	XX
assets	XX
to	XX
$	XX
6.7	XX
billion	XX
from	XX
$	XX
9	XX
billion	XX
.	XX

It	XX
said	XX
the	XX
sale	XX
would	XX
give	XX
it	XX
positive	XX
tangible	XX
capital	XX
of	XX
$	XX
82	XX
million	XX
,	XX
or	XX
about	XX
1.2	XX
%	XX
of	XX
assets	XX
,	XX
from	XX
a	XX
negative	XX
$	XX
33	XX
million	XX
as	XX
of	XX
Sept.	XX
30	XX
,	XX
thus	XX
bringing	XX
CenTrust	XX
close	XX
to	XX
regulatory	XX
standards	XX
.	XX

CenTrust	XX
said	XX
the	XX
branch	XX
sale	XX
would	XX
also	XX
reduce	XX
the	XX
company	XX
's	XX
large	XX
amount	XX
of	XX
good	XX
will	XX
by	XX
about	XX
$	XX
180	XX
million	XX
.	XX

Critics	XX
,	XX
however	XX
,	XX
say	XX
the	XX
branch	XX
sale	XX
will	XX
make	XX
CenTrust	XX
more	XX
dependent	XX
than	XX
ever	XX
on	XX
brokered	XX
deposits	XX
and	XX
junk	XX
bonds	XX
.	XX

Mr.	XX
Paul	XX
counters	XX
that	XX
he	XX
intends	XX
to	XX
further	XX
pare	XX
the	XX
size	XX
of	XX
CenTrust	XX
by	XX
not	XX
renewing	XX
more	XX
than	XX
$	XX
1	XX
billion	XX
of	XX
brokered	XX
certificates	XX
of	XX
deposit	XX
when	XX
they	XX
come	XX
due	XX
.	XX

The	XX
thrift	XX
is	XX
also	XX
working	XX
to	XX
unload	XX
its	XX
junk-bond	XX
portfolio	XX
by	XX
continuing	XX
to	XX
sell	XX
off	XX
the	XX
bonds	XX
,	XX
and	XX
it	XX
plans	XX
to	XX
eventually	XX
place	XX
some	XX
of	XX
them	XX
in	XX
a	XX
separate	XX
affiliate	XX
,	XX
as	XX
required	XX
under	XX
the	XX
new	XX

some	XX
in	XX

contend	XX
that	XX

the	XX
bane	XX
of	XX

sluggish	XX
development	XX

Until	XX
recently	XX
,	XX
national	XX
governments	XX
in	XX
Europe	XX
controlled	XX
most	XX
of	XX
the	XX
air	XX
time	XX
and	XX
allowed	XX
little	XX
or	XX
no	XX
advertising	XX
.	XX

Since	XX
production	XX
costs	XX
were	XX
guaranteed	XX
,	XX
it	XX
did	XX
n't	XX
matter	XX
that	XX
a	XX
program	XX
could	XX
n't	XX
be	XX
sold	XX
abroad	XX
or	XX
put	XX
into	XX
syndication	XX
,	XX
as	XX
most	XX
American	XX
programs	XX
are	XX
.	XX

But	XX
not	XX
much	XX
money	XX
was	XX
spent	XX
on	XX
the	XX
shows	XX
,	XX
either	XX
,	XX
a	XX
situation	XX
that	XX
encouraged	XX
cheap-to-make	XX
talk	XX

while	XX
discouraging	XX
expensive-to-produce	XX
dramas	XX

Now	XX
,	XX
however	XX
,	XX
commercial	XX
channels	XX
are	XX
coming	XX
to	XX
most	XX
European	XX
countries	XX

at	XX
the	XX

Just	XX
last	XX

Greece	XX
authorized	XX

the	XX

the	XX

dating	XX
back	XX

currently	XX
a	XX

Here	XX
,	XX
in	XX
neutral	XX
language	XX
,	XX
is	XX
the	XX
gist	XX
of	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
's	XX
remarks	XX
,	XX
quoted	XX
first	XX
in	XX
the	XX
Village	XX
Voice	XX
while	XX
he	XX
was	XX
a	XX
paid	XX
spokesman	XX
for	XX
the	XX
Rudolph	XX
Giuliani	XX
mayoral	XX
campaign	XX
,	XX
and	XX
then	XX
in	XX
Newsweek	XX
after	XX
he	XX
and	XX
the	XX
campaign	XX
parted	XX
company	XX
.	XX

Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
said	XX
that	XX
many	XX
Jewish	XX
voters	XX
feel	XX
guilty	XX
toward	XX
blacks	XX
,	XX
so	XX
they	XX
support	XX
black	XX
candidates	XX
uncritically	XX
.	XX

He	XX
said	XX
that	XX
many	XX
black	XX
voters	XX
feel	XX
bitter	XX
about	XX
racial	XX
discrimination	XX
,	XX
so	XX
they	XX
,	XX
too	XX
,	XX
support	XX
black	XX
candidates	XX
uncritically	XX
.	XX

He	XX
said	XX
that	XX
Jews	XX
have	XX
contributed	XX
more	XX
to	XX
black	XX
causes	XX
over	XX
the	XX
years	XX
than	XX
vice	XX
versa	XX
.	XX

Of	XX
course	XX
,	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
did	XX
not	XX
use	XX
neutral	XX
language	XX
.	XX

As	XX
a	XX
practitioner	XX
of	XX
ethnic	XX
humor	XX
from	XX
the	XX
old	XX
days	XX
on	XX
the	XX
Borscht	XX
Belt	XX
,	XX
live	XX
television	XX
and	XX
the	XX
nightclub	XX
circuit	XX
,	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
instinctively	XX
reached	XX
for	XX
the	XX
vernacular	XX
.	XX

He	XX
said	XX
Jews	XX
were	XX
``	XX
sick	XX
with	XX
complexes	XX
''	XX
;	XX
and	XX
he	XX
called	XX
David	XX
Dinkins	XX
,	XX
Mr.	XX
Giuliani	XX
's	XX
black	XX
opponent	XX
,	XX
``	XX
a	XX
fancy	XX
shvartze	XX
with	XX
a	XX
mustache	XX
.	XX
''	XX

If	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
had	XX
used	XX
less	XX
derogatory	XX
language	XX
to	XX
articulate	XX
his	XX
amateur	XX
analysis	XX
of	XX
the	XX
voting	XX
behavior	XX
of	XX
his	XX
fellow	XX
New	XX
Yorkers	XX
,	XX
would	XX
the	XX
water	XX
be	XX
quite	XX
so	XX
hot	XX
?	XX

It	XX
probably	XX
would	XX
,	XX
because	XX
few	XX
or	XX
none	XX
of	XX
the	XX
people	XX
upset	XX
by	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
's	XX
remarks	XX
have	XX
bothered	XX
to	XX
distinguish	XX
between	XX
the	XX
substance	XX
of	XX
his	XX
comments	XX
and	XX
the	XX
fact	XX
that	XX
he	XX
used	XX
insulting	XX
language	XX
.	XX

In	XX
addition	XX
,	XX
some	XX
of	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
's	XX
critics	XX
have	XX
implied	XX
that	XX
his	XX
type	XX
of	XX
ethnic	XX
humor	XX
is	XX
itself	XX
a	XX
form	XX
of	XX
racism	XX
.	XX

For	XX
example	XX
,	XX
the	XX
New	XX
York	XX
state	XX
counsel	XX
for	XX
the	XX
NAACP	XX
said	XX
that	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
is	XX
``	XX
like	XX
a	XX
dinosaur	XX
.	XX

People	XX
are	XX
fast	XX
leaving	XX
the	XX
place	XX
where	XX
he	XX
is	XX
stuck	XX
.	XX
''	XX

These	XX
critics	XX
fail	XX
to	XX
distinguish	XX
between	XX
the	XX
type	XX
of	XX
ethnic	XX
humor	XX
that	XX
aims	XX
at	XX
disparaging	XX
another	XX
group	XX
,	XX
such	XX
as	XX
``	XX
Polish	XX
jokes	XX
''	XX
;	XX
and	XX
the	XX
type	XX
that	XX
is	XX
double-edged	XX
,	XX
aiming	XX
inward	XX
as	XX
well	XX
as	XX
outward	XX
.	XX

The	XX
latter	XX
typically	XX
is	XX
the	XX
humor	XX
of	XX
the	XX
underdog	XX
,	XX
and	XX
it	XX
was	XX
perfected	XX
by	XX
both	XX
blacks	XX
and	XX
Jews	XX
on	XX
the	XX
minstrel	XX
and	XX
vaudeville	XX
stage	XX
as	XX
a	XX
means	XX
of	XX
mocking	XX
their	XX
white	XX
and	XX
gentile	XX
audiences	XX
along	XX
with	XX
themselves	XX
.	XX

In	XX
the	XX
hands	XX
of	XX
a	XX
zealot	XX
like	XX
Lenny	XX
Bruce	XX
,	XX
this	XX
double-edged	XX
blade	XX
could	XX
cut	XX
both	XX
the	XX
self	XX
and	XX
the	XX
audience	XX
to	XX
ribbons	XX
.	XX

But	XX
wielded	XX
by	XX
a	XX
pro	XX
like	XX
Jackie	XX
Mason	XX
,	XX
it	XX
is	XX
a	XX
constructive	XX
form	XX
of	XX
mischief	XX
.	XX

Why	XX
constructive	XX
?	XX

Because	XX
despite	XX
all	XX
the	XX
media	XX
prattle	XX
about	XX
comedy	XX
and	XX
politics	XX
not	XX
mixing	XX
,	XX
they	XX
are	XX
similar	XX
in	XX
one	XX
respect	XX
:	XX
Both	XX
can	XX
serve	XX
as	XX
mechanisms	XX
for	XX
easing	XX
tensions	XX
and	XX
facilitating	XX
the	XX
co-existence	XX
of	XX
groups	XX
in	XX
conflict	XX
.	XX

That	XX
's	XX
why	XX
it	XX
's	XX
dangerous	XX
to	XX
have	XX
well-intentioned	XX
thought	XX
police	XX
,	XX
on	XX
college	XX
campuses	XX
and	XX
elsewhere	XX
,	XX
taboo	XX
all	XX
critical	XX
mention	XX
of	XX
group	XX
differences	XX
.	XX

As	XX
Elizabeth	XX
Kristol	XX
wrote	XX
in	XX
the	XX
New	XX
York	XX
Times	XX
just	XX
before	XX
the	XX
Mason	XX
donnybrook	XX
,	XX
``	XX
Perhaps	XX
intolerance	XX
would	XX
not	XX
boil	XX
over	XX
with	XX
such	XX
intensity	XX
if	XX
honest	XX
differences	XX
were	XX
allowed	XX
to	XX
simmer	XX
.	XX
''	XX

The	XX
question	XX
is	XX
,	XX
if	XX
group	XX
conflicts	XX
still	XX
exist	XX
-LRB-	XX
as	XX
undeniably	XX
they	XX
do	XX
-RRB-	XX
,	XX
and	XX
if	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
's	XX
type	XX
of	XX
ethnic	XX
humor	XX
is	XX
passe	XX
,	XX
then	XX
what	XX
other	XX
means	XX
do	XX
we	XX
have	XX
for	XX
letting	XX
off	XX
steam	XX
?	XX

Do	XX
n't	XX
say	XX
the	XX
TV	XX
sitcom	XX
,	XX
because	XX
that	XX
happens	XX
to	XX
be	XX
a	XX
genre	XX
that	XX
,	XX
in	XX
its	XX
desperate	XX
need	XX
to	XX
attract	XX
everybody	XX
and	XX
offend	XX
nobody	XX
,	XX
resembles	XX
politics	XX
more	XX
than	XX
it	XX
does	XX
comedy	XX
.	XX

It	XX
is	XX
true	XX
that	XX
the	XX
best	XX
sitcoms	XX
do	XX
allow	XX
group	XX
differences	XX
to	XX
simmer	XX
:	XX
yuppies	XX
vs.	XX
blue-collar	XX
Bostonians	XX
in	XX
``	XX
Cheers	XX
''	XX
;	XX
children	XX
vs.	XX
adults	XX
in	XX
``	XX
The	XX
Cosby	XX
Show	XX
.	XX
''	XX

But	XX
these	XX
are	XX
not	XX
the	XX
differences	XX
that	XX
make	XX
headlines	XX
.	XX

In	XX
``	XX
Chicken	XX
Soup	XX
,	XX
''	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
plays	XX
Jackie	XX
,	XX
a	XX
Jewish	XX
bachelor	XX
courting	XX
Maddie	XX
-LRB-	XX
Lynn	XX
Redgrave	XX
-RRB-	XX
,	XX
an	XX
Irish	XX
widow	XX
and	XX
mother	XX
of	XX
three	XX
,	XX
against	XX
the	XX
wishes	XX
of	XX
his	XX
mother	XX
-LRB-	XX
Rita	XX
Karin	XX
-RRB-	XX
and	XX
her	XX
brother	XX
Michael	XX
-LRB-	XX
Brandon	XX
Maggart	XX
-RRB-	XX
.	XX

It	XX
's	XX
worth	XX
noting	XX
that	XX
both	XX
disapproving	XX
relatives	XX
are	XX
immigrants	XX
.	XX

At	XX
least	XX
,	XX
they	XX
both	XX
speak	XX
with	XX
strong	XX
accents	XX
,	XX
as	XX
do	XX
Jackie	XX
and	XX
Maddie	XX
.	XX

It	XX
could	XX
n't	XX
be	XX
more	XX
obvious	XX
that	XX
``	XX
Chicken	XX
Soup	XX
''	XX
is	XX
being	XX
made	XX
from	XX
an	XX
old	XX
recipe	XX
.	XX

And	XX
a	XX
safe	XX
one	XX
--	XX
imagine	XX
if	XX
the	XX
romance	XX
in	XX
question	XX
were	XX
between	XX
an	XX
Orthodox	XX
Jew	XX
and	XX
a	XX
member	XX
of	XX
the	XX
Nation	XX
of	XX
Islam	XX
.	XX

Back	XX
in	XX
the	XX
1920s	XX
,	XX
the	XX
play	XX
and	XX
movie	XX
versions	XX
of	XX
``	XX
Abie	XX
's	XX
Irish	XX
Rose	XX
''	XX
made	XX
the	XX
theme	XX
of	XX
courtship	XX
between	XX
the	XX
assimilated	XX
offspring	XX
of	XX
Jewish	XX
and	XX
Irish	XX
immigrants	XX
so	XX
popular	XX
that	XX
its	XX
author	XX
,	XX
Anne	XX
Nichols	XX
,	XX
lost	XX
a	XX
plagiarism	XX
suit	XX
on	XX
the	XX
grounds	XX
that	XX
the	XX
plot	XX
has	XX
entered	XX
the	XX
public	XX
domain	XX
.	XX

And	XX
it	XX
has	XX
remained	XX
there	XX
,	XX
as	XX
evidenced	XX
by	XX
its	XX
reappearance	XX
in	XX
a	XX
1972	XX
CBS	XX
sitcom	XX
called	XX
``	XX
Bridget	XX
Loves	XX
Bernie	XX
,	XX
''	XX
whose	XX
sole	XX
distinction	XX
was	XX
that	XX
it	XX
led	XX
to	XX
the	XX
real-life	XX
marriage	XX
of	XX
Meredith	XX
Baxter	XX
and	XX
David	XX
Birney	XX
.	XX

Clearly	XX
,	XX
the	XX
question	XX
with	XX
``	XX
Chicken	XX
Soup	XX
''	XX
is	XX
not	XX
whether	XX
the	XX
pot	XX
will	XX
boil	XX
over	XX
,	XX
but	XX
whether	XX
it	XX
will	XX
simmer	XX
at	XX
all	XX
.	XX

So	XX
far	XX
,	XX
the	XX
bubbles	XX
have	XX
been	XX
few	XX
and	XX
far	XX
between	XX
.	XX

Part	XX
of	XX
the	XX
problem	XX
is	XX
the	XX
tendency	XX
of	XX
all	XX
sitcoms	XX
,	XX
ever	XX
since	XX
the	XX
didactic	XX
days	XX
of	XX
Norman	XX
Lear	XX
,	XX
to	XX
preach	XX
about	XX
social	XX
issues	XX
.	XX

To	XX
some	XX
extent	XX
,	XX
this	XX
tendency	XX
emerges	XX
whenever	XX
the	XX
show	XX
tries	XX
to	XX
enlighten	XX
us	XX
about	XX
ethnic	XX
stereotypes	XX
by	XX
reversing	XX
them	XX
.	XX

For	XX
instance	XX
,	XX
Michael	XX
dislikes	XX
Jackie	XX
not	XX
because	XX
he	XX
's	XX
a	XX
shrewd	XX
Jewish	XX
businessman	XX
,	XX
but	XX
because	XX
he	XX
quits	XX
his	XX
well-paying	XX
job	XX
as	XX
a	XX
salesman	XX
in	XX
order	XX
to	XX
become	XX
a	XX
social	XX
worker	XX
.	XX

Even	XX
more	XX
problematic	XX
is	XX
the	XX
incompatibility	XX
between	XX
sitcom	XX
preachiness	XX
and	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
's	XX
comic	XX
persona	XX
.	XX

The	XX
best	XX
moments	XX
in	XX
the	XX
show	XX
occur	XX
at	XX
the	XX
beginning	XX
and	XX
the	XX
end	XX
-LRB-	XX
and	XX
occasionally	XX
in	XX
the	XX
middle	XX
-RRB-	XX
,	XX
when	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
slips	XX
into	XX
his	XX
standup	XX
mode	XX
and	XX
starts	XX
meting	XX
out	XX
that	XX
old-fashioned	XX
Jewish	XX
mischief	XX
to	XX
other	XX
people	XX
as	XX
well	XX
as	XX
to	XX
himself	XX
.	XX

But	XX
too	XX
often	XX
,	XX
these	XX
routines	XX
lack	XX
spark	XX
because	XX
this	XX
sitcom	XX
,	XX
like	XX
all	XX
sitcoms	XX
,	XX
is	XX
timid	XX
about	XX
confronting	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
's	XX
stock	XX
in	XX
trade	XX
-	XX
ethnic	XX
differences	XX
.	XX

I	XX
'm	XX
not	XX
suggesting	XX
that	XX
the	XX
producers	XX
start	XX
putting	XX
together	XX
episodes	XX
about	XX
topics	XX
like	XX
the	XX
Catholic-Jewish	XX
dispute	XX
over	XX
the	XX
Carmelite	XX
convent	XX
at	XX
Auschwitz	XX
.	XX

That	XX
issue	XX
,	XX
like	XX
racial	XX
tensions	XX
in	XX
New	XX
York	XX
City	XX
,	XX
will	XX
have	XX
to	XX
cool	XX
down	XX
,	XX
not	XX
heat	XX
up	XX
,	XX
before	XX
it	XX
can	XX
simmer	XX
.	XX

But	XX
I	XX
am	XX
suggesting	XX
that	XX
they	XX
stop	XX
requiring	XX
Mr.	XX
Mason	XX
to	XX
interrupt	XX
his	XX
classic	XX
shtik	XX
with	XX
some	XX
line	XX
about	XX
``	XX
caring	XX
for	XX
other	XX
people	XX
''	XX
that	XX
would	XX
sound	XX
shmaltzy	XX
on	XX
the	XX
lips	XX
of	XX
Miss	XX
America	XX
.	XX

At	XX
your	XX
age	XX
,	XX
Jackie	XX
,	XX
you	XX
ought	XX
to	XX
know	XX
that	XX
you	XX
ca	XX
n't	XX
make	XX
soup	XX
without	XX
turning	XX
up	XX

flame	XX

win	XX
the	XX

went	XX
ahead	XX

A	XX

Shearson	XX

Ms.	XX
Garzarelli	XX
had	XX
warned	XX
clients	XX
to	XX
take	XX
their	XX
money	XX
out	XX
of	XX
the	XX
market	XX
before	XX
the	XX
1987	XX

Friday	XX
's	XX
big	XX
drop	XX
,	XX
she	XX
says	XX
,	XX
``	XX
was	XX
not	XX
a	XX
crash	XX

massacre	XX

those	XX
that	XX
occurred	XX
in	XX

as	XX
in	XX
those	XX
two	XX
years	XX

her	XX
stock	XX
market	XX
indicators	XX
are	XX
positive	XX

she	XX
thinks	XX
the	XX
damage	XX
will	XX
be	XX
short-lived	XX

contained	XX
.	XX

``	XX
Those	XX
corrections	XX
lasted	XX
one	XX

says	XX
that	XX

climb	XX

an	XX

heard	XX

he	XX
quotes	XX

did	XX
repeat	XX

several	XX
times	XX
as	XX
an	XX
indication	XX
of	XX
his	XX
support	XX

He	XX
used	XX
about	XX
56	XX
words	XX
defending	XX

witnesses	XX

constitutional	XX
rights	XX

Unfortunately	XX
,	XX
by	XX
my	XX
rough	XX
guess	XX
,	XX
he	XX
used	XX
better	XX
than	XX
5,000	XX
words	XX
heaping	XX
scorn	XX
on	XX
the	XX
witnesses	XX
for	XX
exercising	XX

Everything	XX

why	XX
is	XX
his	XX
investigation	XX
so	XX
oriented	XX

identify	XX

who	XX
after	XX
all	XX
is	XX
really	XX
a	XX
bit	XX
player	XX
on	XX
the	XX
stage	XX
,	XX
but	XX
the	XX
attempt	XX
by	XX

body	XX

-RRB-	XX

The	XX
system	XX
is	XX
the	XX
problem	XX

not	XX
an	XX
individual	XX
member	XX

Individuals	XX
can	XX
always	XX
have	XX
their	XX
hands	XX

It	XX
's	XX
when	XX
such	XX
slapping	XX
does	XX
n't	XX
occur	XX
that	XX
we	XX
've	XX
got	XX
trouble	XX

I	XX
do	XX
not	XX
by	XX
any	XX
means	XX
defend	XX
HUD	XX
management	XX
.	XX

But	XX
I	XX
think	XX
the	XX
kind	XX
of	XX
congressional	XX
investigation	XX
that	XX
has	XX
been	XX
pursued	XX
is	XX
a	XX
far	XX
greater	XX
danger	XX
to	XX
American	XX
notions	XX
of	XX
liberty	XX
and	XX
freedom	XX
than	XX
any	XX
incompetency	XX
-LRB-	XX
and	XX
,	XX
yes	XX
,	XX
maybe	XX
criminality	XX
-RRB-	XX
within	XX
HUD	XX
could	XX
possibly	XX
generate	XX
.	XX

The	XX
last	XX
time	XX
I	XX
saw	XX
a	XX
similar	XX
congressional	XX
hearing	XX
was	XX
when	XX
``	XX
Tail	XX

his	XX
work	XX

Raymond	XX
Weber	XX

Parsippany	XX
,	XX
N.J	XX
.	XX

I	XX
disagree	XX
with	XX
the	XX
statement	XX
by	XX
Mr.	XX
Lantos	XX
that	XX
one	XX
should	XX
not	XX
draw	XX
an	XX
adverse	XX
inference	XX
against	XX
former	XX
HUD	XX
officials	XX
who	XX
assert	XX
their	XX
Fifth	XX
Amendment	XX
privilege	XX
against	XX
self-incrimination	XX
in	XX
congressional	XX
hearings	XX
.	XX

The	XX
Fifth	XX
Amendment	XX
states	XX
in	XX
relevant	XX
part	XX
that	XX
no	XX
person	XX
``	XX
shall	XX
be	XX
compelled	XX
,	XX
in	XX
any	XX
criminal	XX
case	XX
,	XX
to	XX
be	XX
a	XX
witness	XX
against	XX
himself	XX
.	XX
''	XX

This	XX
privilege	XX
against	XX
self-incrimination	XX
precludes	XX
the	XX
drawing	XX
of	XX
an	XX
adverse	XX
inference	XX
against	XX
a	XX
criminal	XX
defendant	XX
who	XX
chooses	XX
not	XX
to	XX
testify	XX
.	XX

Thus	XX
,	XX
in	XX
a	XX
criminal	XX
case	XX
,	XX
a	XX
prosecutor	XX
can	XX
not	XX
comment	XX
on	XX
a	XX
defendant	XX
's	XX
failure	XX
to	XX
testify	XX
nor	XX
can	XX
the	XX
defendant	XX
be	XX
compelled	XX
to	XX
take	XX
the	XX
stand	XX
as	XX
a	XX
witness	XX
,	XX
thus	XX
forcing	XX
him	XX
to	XX
``	XX
take	XX
the	XX
Fifth	XX
.	XX
''	XX

The	XX
privilege	XX
,	XX
however	XX
,	XX
has	XX
been	XX
limited	XX
in	XX
accordance	XX
with	XX
its	XX
plain	XX
language	XX
to	XX
protect	XX
the	XX
defendant	XX
in	XX
criminal	XX
matters	XX
only	XX
.	XX

The	XX
Supreme	XX
Court	XX
and	XX
some	XX
states	XX
have	XX
specifically	XX
recognized	XX
that	XX
``	XX
the	XX
Fifth	XX
Amendment	XX
does	XX
not	XX
preclude	XX
the	XX
inference	XX
where	XX
the	XX
privilege	XX
is	XX
claimed	XX
by	XX
a	XX
party	XX
to	XX
a	XX
civil	XX
cause	XX

.	XX

Thus	XX
,	XX
in	XX
a	XX
civil	XX
case	XX
,	XX
a	XX
defendant	XX
may	XX
be	XX
called	XX
as	XX
a	XX
witness	XX
,	XX
he	XX
may	XX
be	XX
forced	XX
to	XX
testify	XX
or	XX
take	XX
the	XX
Fifth	XX
,	XX
and	XX
his	XX
taking	XX
of	XX
the	XX
Fifth	XX
may	XX
permit	XX
the	XX
drawing	XX
of	XX
an	XX
adverse	XX
inference	XX
against	XX
him	XX
in	XX
the	XX
civil	XX
matter	XX
.	XX

He	XX
may	XX
take	XX
the	XX
Fifth	XX
in	XX
a	XX
civil	XX
matter	XX
only	XX
if	XX
he	XX
has	XX
a	XX
good	XX

and	XX
justifiable	XX
belief	XX
that	XX
his	XX
testimony	XX
may	XX
subject	XX
him	XX
to	XX
criminal	XX
prosecution	XX
.	XX

Allowing	XX
the	XX
defendant	XX
to	XX
take	XX
the	XX
Fifth	XX
in	XX
a	XX
civil	XX
matter	XX
is	XX
not	XX
based	XX
on	XX
a	XX
constitutional	XX
right	XX
to	XX
refuse	XX
to	XX
testify	XX
where	XX
one	XX
's	XX
testimony	XX

The	XX
subcommittee	XX

Congress	XX

the	XX
American	XX
public	XX
have	XX
every	XX
right	XX
to	XX
draw	XX
the	XX
adverse	XX
inference	XX
and	XX
to	XX
concur	XX
with	XX
Mr.	XX

Drawing	XX

But	XX
their	XX
study	XX
,	XX
which	XX
spanned	XX
the	XX
1962-85	XX
period	XX

has	XX

shown	XX

be	XX
jinxed	XX

the	XX

Transportation	XX

were	XX
making	XX

nervous	XX

The	XX
1987	XX
crash	XX
brought	XX
the	XX
Reagan	XX
administration	XX
and	XX
Democratic	XX
lawmakers	XX
to	XX
the	XX
table	XX
for	XX
the	XX
first	XX
budget	XX
summit	XX
,	XX
resulting	XX
in	XX
a	XX
two-year	XX
plan	XX
to	XX
reduce	XX
the	XX
deficit	XX
by	XX
more	XX
than	XX
$	XX
76	XX
billion	XX
--	XX
even	XX
though	XX
the	XX
deficit	XX
actually	XX
rose	XX
by	XX
nearly	XX
$	XX
12	XX

period	XX

But	XX
,	XX
barring	XX
further	XX
drops	XX
in	XX
the	XX
market	XX
this	XX
week	XX
,	XX
a	XX
similar	XX
outcome	XX
does	XX
n't	XX
seem	XX
likely	XX
this	XX

Lawmakers	XX
and	XX
administration	XX
officials	XX
agree	XX
that	XX
Friday	XX
's	XX
drop	XX
,	XX
by	XX
itself	XX
,	XX
is	XX
n't	XX
enough	XX
to	XX
force	XX
both	XX
sides	XX
back	XX
to	XX
the	XX
table	XX
to	XX
try	XX
to	XX
reach	XX
a	XX
deficit-reduction	XX
agreement	XX
that	XX
would	XX
be	XX
more	XX
serious	XX

more	XX
far-reaching	XX
than	XX
last	XX
spring	XX

gimmick-ridden	XX
plan	XX

which	XX
still	XX
is	XX
n't	XX
fully	XX
implemented	XX

One	XX
of	XX
the	XX
biggest	XX
reasons	XX
that	XX
new	XX
talks	XX
are	XX
n't	XX
likely	XX
to	XX
come	XX
about	XX
is	XX
that	XX
,	XX
as	XX
everyone	XX
learned	XX
in	XX

the	XX
economy	XX
and	XX
the	XX

can	XX
survive	XX
a	XX
one-day	XX
508-point	XX

Even	XX
Mr.	XX

the	XX

what	XX

been	XX
trying	XX
to	XX
do	XX

forcing	XX
the	XX

took	XX

Treasury	XX
officials	XX
have	XX
been	XX
arguing	XX
for	XX
months	XX
that	XX
the	XX
dollar	XX
's	XX
strength	XX
was	XX
out	XX
of	XX

with	XX

that	XX
has	XX
sustained	XX
manufacturers	XX
for	XX
several	XX
years	XX

The	XX
market	XX
drop	XX
has	XX
now	XX
apparently	XX
convinced	XX
foreign	XX

that	XX
the	XX
Treasury	XX
was	XX

That	XX
was	XX
n't	XX
the	XX
case	XX
in	XX
1987	XX
,	XX
when	XX
the	XX
dollar	XX
was	XX
so	XX
weak	XX
that	XX
some	XX
economists	XX
and	XX
government	XX
officials	XX
seriously	XX
worried	XX
that	XX
it	XX
might	XX
collapse	XX

producing	XX
panic	XX
among	XX
foreign	XX
investors	XX

diminishing	XX
the	XX
flow	XX
of	XX
foreign	XX
capital	XX
to	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX

Another	XX
big	XX
difference	XX
between	XX
1987	XX

1989	XX

In	XX

The	XX
consensus	XX
among	XX

is	XX
that	XX
it	XX

been	XX
criticized	XX
by	XX

its	XX

lost	XX
and	XX
mistakes	XX
made	XX
in	XX
the	XX
early	XX
episodes	XX
,	XX
Shane	XX

capital	XX
should	XX
be	XX
just	XX
about	XX
exhausted	XX
by	XX
the	XX
final	XX
13th	XX
week	XX
.	XX

In	XX
the	XX
opening	XX
episode	XX
we	XX
learn	XX
that	XX
Michelle	XX
,	XX
a	XX
junior	XX
bond	XX
trader	XX
,	XX
has	XX
indeed	XX
pulled	XX
off	XX
another	XX
million	XX
before	XX

.	XX

Trouble	XX
is	XX
,	XX
she	XX
has	XX
lost	XX
it	XX
just	XX
as	XX
quickly	XX
.	XX

Rather	XX
than	XX
keep	XX
the	XX
loss	XX
a	XX
secret	XX
from	XX
the	XX
outside	XX
world	XX
,	XX
Michelle	XX
blabs	XX
about	XX
it	XX
to	XX
a	XX
sandwich	XX
man	XX
while	XX
ordering	XX
lunch	XX
over	XX
the	XX
phone	XX
.	XX

Little	XX
chance	XX
that	XX
Shane	XX
Longman	XX
is	XX
going	XX
to	XX
recoup	XX
today	XX
.	XX

Traders	XX
spend	XX
the	XX
morning	XX
frantically	XX
selling	XX
bonds	XX
,	XX
in	XX
the	XX
belief	XX
that	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX
monthly	XX
trade	XX
figures	XX
will	XX
look	XX
lousy	XX
.	XX

Ah	XX
,	XX
perfidious	XX
Columbia	XX
!	XX

The	XX
trade	XX
figures	XX
turn	XX
out	XX
well	XX
,	XX
and	XX
all	XX
those	XX
recently	XX
unloaded	XX
bonds	XX
spurt	XX
in	XX
price	XX
.	XX

So	XX
much	XX
for	XX
anticipating	XX
the	XX
market	XX
by	XX
a	XX
fraction	XX
of	XX
a	XX
second	XX
.	XX

And	XX
a	XX
large	XX
slice	XX
of	XX
the	XX
first	XX
episode	XX
is	XX
devoted	XX
to	XX
efforts	XX
to	XX
get	XX
rid	XX
of	XX
some	XX
nearly	XX
worthless	XX
Japanese	XX
bonds	XX
-LRB-	XX
since	XX
when	XX
is	XX
anything	XX
Japanese	XX
nearly	XX
worthless	XX
nowadays	XX
?	XX
-RRB-	XX
.	XX

Surprisingly	XX
,	XX
Shane	XX
Longman	XX
survives	XX
the	XX
week	XX
,	XX
only	XX
to	XX
have	XX
a	XX
senior	XX
executive	XX
innocently	XX
bumble	XX
his	XX
way	XX
into	XX
becoming	XX
the	XX
target	XX
of	XX
a	XX
criminal	XX
insider	XX
trading	XX
investigation	XX
.	XX

Instead	XX
of	XX
closing	XX
ranks	XX
to	XX
protect	XX
the	XX
firm	XX
's	XX
reputation	XX
,	XX
the	XX
executive	XX
's	XX
internal	XX
rivals	XX
,	XX
led	XX
by	XX
a	XX
loutish	XX
American	XX
,	XX
demand	XX
his	XX
resignation	XX
.	XX

The	XX
plot	XX
is	XX
thwarted	XX
when	XX
the	XX
firm	XX
's	XX
major	XX
stockholder	XX
,	XX
kelp	XX
farming	XX
on	XX
the	XX
other	XX
side	XX
of	XX
the	XX
globe	XX
,	XX
hurries	XX
home	XX
to	XX
support	XX
the	XX
executive	XX
.	XX

But	XX
the	XX
investigation	XX
continues	XX
.	XX

If	XX
you	XX
can	XX
swallow	XX
the	XX
premise	XX
that	XX
the	XX
rewards	XX
for	XX
such	XX
ineptitude	XX
are	XX
six-figure	XX
salaries	XX
,	XX
you	XX
still	XX
are	XX
left	XX
puzzled	XX
,	XX
because	XX
few	XX
of	XX
the	XX
yuppies	XX
consume	XX
very	XX
conspicuously	XX
.	XX

In	XX
fact	XX
,	XX
few	XX
consume	XX
much	XX
of	XX
anything	XX
.	XX

Two	XX
share	XX
a	XX
house	XX
almost	XX
devoid	XX
of	XX
furniture	XX
.	XX

Michelle	XX
lives	XX
in	XX
a	XX
hotel	XX
room	XX
,	XX
and	XX
although	XX
she	XX
drives	XX
a	XX
canary-colored	XX
Porsche	XX
,	XX
she	XX
has	XX
n't	XX
time	XX
to	XX
clean	XX
or	XX
repair	XX
it	XX
;	XX
the	XX
beat-up	XX
vehicle	XX
can	XX
be	XX
started	XX
only	XX
with	XX
a	XX
huge	XX
pair	XX
of	XX
pliers	XX
because	XX
the	XX
ignition	XX
key	XX
has	XX
broken	XX
off	XX
in	XX
the	XX
lock	XX
.	XX

And	XX
it	XX
takes	XX
Declan	XX
,	XX
the	XX
obligatory	XX
ladies	XX
'	XX
man	XX
of	XX
the	XX
cast	XX
,	XX
until	XX
the	XX
third	XX
episode	XX
to	XX
get	XX
past	XX
first	XX
base	XX
with	XX
any	XX
of	XX
his	XX
prey	XX
.	XX

Perhaps	XX
the	XX
explanation	XX
for	XX
these	XX
anomalies	XX
is	XX
that	XX
class-conscious	XX
Britain	XX
is	XX
n't	XX
ready	XX
to	XX
come	XX
to	XX
terms	XX
with	XX
the	XX
wealth	XX
created	XX
by	XX
the	XX
Thatcherian	XX
free-enterprise	XX
regime	XX
.	XX

After	XX
all	XX
,	XX
this	XX
is	XX
n't	XX
old	XX
money	XX
,	XX
but	XX
new	XX
money	XX
,	XX
and	XX
in	XX
many	XX
cases	XX
,	XX
young	XX
money	XX
.	XX

This	XX
attitude	XX
is	XX
clearly	XX
illustrated	XX
in	XX
the	XX
treatment	XX
of	XX
Max	XX
,	XX
the	XX
trading	XX
room	XX
's	XX
most	XX
flamboyant	XX
character	XX
.	XX

Yuppily	XX
enough	XX
,	XX
he	XX
lives	XX
in	XX
a	XX
lavishly	XX
furnished	XX
converted	XX
church	XX
,	XX
wears	XX
designer	XX
clothes	XX
and	XX
drives	XX
an	XX
antique	XX
car	XX
.	XX

But	XX
apparently	XX
to	XX
make	XX
him	XX
palatable	XX
,	XX
even	XX
lovable	XX
,	XX
to	XX
the	XX
masses	XX
,	XX
the	XX
script	XX
inflates	XX
pony-tailed	XX
Max	XX
into	XX
an	XX
eccentric	XX
genius	XX
,	XX
master	XX
of	XX
11	XX
Chinese	XX
dialects	XX
.	XX

He	XX
takes	XX
his	XX
wash	XX
to	XX
the	XX
laundromat	XX
,	XX
where	XX
he	XX
meets	XX
a	XX
punky	XX
French	XX
girl	XX
who	XX
dupes	XX
him	XX
into	XX
providing	XX
a	XX
home	XX
for	XX
her	XX
pet	XX
piranha	XX
and	XX
then	XX
promptly	XX
steals	XX
his	XX
car	XX
and	XX
dumps	XX
it	XX
in	XX
Dieppe	XX
.	XX

In	XX
producing	XX
and	XX
promoting	XX

,	XX
''	XX
Thames	XX
has	XX
spent	XX
about	XX
as	XX
much	XX
as	XX
Shane	XX
Longman	XX
loses	XX
on	XX
a	XX
good	XX
day	XX

inconsiderable	XX

,	XX
and	XX

have	XX
been	XX
much	XX
higher	XX
had	XX
not	XX
the	XX
cost	XX
of	XX

Another	XX
half	XX

went	XX
for	XX
a	XX
volley	XX
of	XX
full-page	XX

six	XX
major	XX
British	XX
newspapers	XX
and	XX
for	XX
huge	XX

incentive	XX
for	XX

producers	XX

it	XX
,	XX
Mr.	XX

simultaneously	XX
has	XX
put	XX
his	XX

on	XX

as	XX
an	XX
aspersion	XX
on	XX
the	XX
advocates	XX

Rather	XX
,	XX
it	XX
is	XX
born	XX
of	XX
frustration	XX
with	XX
having	XX
to	XX
combat	XX
constantly	XX
changing	XX
strains	XX
of	XX
a	XX
statist	XX
idea	XX
that	XX

had	XX
been	XX
eliminated	XX
in	XX

early	XX

along	XX
with	XX

It	XX
is	XX
back	XX
with	XX
us	XX
again	XX
,	XX
in	XX
the	XX
form	XX
of	XX
legislation	XX
to	XX
pay	XX

under	XX

``	XX

serious	XX
shot	XX
at	XX

passage	XX

fall	XX
.	XX

Why	XX
does	XX
the	XX
national-service	XX
virus	XX
keep	XX
coming	XX
back	XX
?	XX

Perhaps	XX
it	XX
is	XX
because	XX
utopian	XX
nostalgia	XX
evokes	XX
both	XX
military	XX
experience	XX
and	XX
the	XX
social	XX
gospel	XX
.	XX

If	XX
only	XX

get	XX
America	XX

might	XX

able	XX
to	XX
teach	XX
self-discipline	XX
again	XX
and	XX
revive	XX
the	XX
spirit	XX

giving	XX
.	XX

A	XX
quarter	XX
of	XX
a	XX
century	XX
ago	XX
national	XX
service	XX
was	XX
promoted	XX
as	XX
a	XX
way	XX
of	XX
curing	XX
the	XX
manifest	XX
inequities	XX
of	XX
the	XX
draft	XX
--	XX
by	XX
,	XX
of	XX
all	XX
things	XX
,	XX
expanding	XX
the	XX
draft	XX
.	XX

Those	XX
of	XX
us	XX
who	XX
resisted	XX
the	XX
idea	XX
then	XX
suspect	XX
today	XX
that	XX
an	XX
obligation	XX
of	XX
government	XX
service	XX
for	XX
all	XX
young	XX
people	XX
is	XX
still	XX
the	XX
true	XX
long-term	XX
aim	XX
of	XX
many	XX
national-service	XX
backers	XX
,	XX
despite	XX
their	XX
protests	XX
that	XX
present	XX
plans	XX
contain	XX
no	XX
coercion	XX
.	XX

Choice	XX
of	XX
the	XX
volunteer	XX
military	XX
in	XX
the	XX
1970s	XX
seemed	XX
to	XX
doom	XX
national	XX
service	XX
as	XX
much	XX
as	XX
the	XX
draft	XX
.	XX

But	XX
the	XX
virus	XX
was	XX
kept	XX
alive	XX
in	XX
sociology	XX
departments	XX
until	XX
a	XX
couple	XX
of	XX
years	XX
ago	XX
,	XX
when	XX
it	XX
again	XX
was	XX
let	XX
loose	XX
.	XX

This	XX
time	XX
it	XX
attempted	XX
to	XX
invade	XX
two	XX
connected	XX
problems	XX
,	XX
the	XX
rising	XX
cost	XX
of	XX
higher	XX
education	XX
and	XX
the	XX
rising	XX
expense	XX
to	XX
the	XX
federal	XX
government	XX
of	XX
educational	XX
grants	XX
and	XX
loans	XX
.	XX

Why	XX
not	XX
keep	XX
and	XX
even	XX
expand	XX
the	XX
loans	XX
and	XX
grants	XX
,	XX
the	XX
advocates	XX
reasoned	XX
,	XX
but	XX
require	XX
some	XX
form	XX
of	XX
service	XX
from	XX
each	XX
recipient	XX
?	XX

Military	XX
service	XX
,	XX
moreover	XX
,	XX
could	XX
be	XX
a	XX
national-service	XX
option	XX
.	XX

Thus	XX
,	XX
undoubtedly	XX
it	XX
was	XX
hoped	XX
that	XX
the	XX
new	XX
strain	XX
of	XX
national	XX
service	XX
would	XX
prove	XX
contagious	XX
,	XX
infecting	XX
patriotic	XX
conservatives	XX
,	XX
pay-as-you-go	XX
moderates	XX
,	XX
and	XX
idealistic	XX
liberals	XX
.	XX

The	XX
Democratic	XX
Leadership	XX
Council	XX
,	XX
a	XX
centrist	XX
group	XX
sponsoring	XX
the	XX
plan	XX
,	XX
surely	XX
thought	XX
it	XX
might	XX
help	XX
the	XX
party	XX
to	XX
attract	XX
support	XX
,	XX
especially	XX
among	XX
college	XX
students	XX
and	XX
their	XX
parents	XX
.	XX

A	XX
provision	XX
allowing	XX
grants	XX
to	XX
be	XX
applied	XX
to	XX
first-home	XX
purchases	XX
was	XX
added	XX
to	XX
appeal	XX
to	XX
those	XX
who	XX
had	XX
had	XX
enough	XX
of	XX
schooling	XX
.	XX

The	XX
DLC	XX
plan	XX
envisaged	XX
``	XX

emptying	XX

$	XX
100	XX

With	XX
a	XX

$	XX
10,000	XX
voucher	XX
payment	XX
at	XX
the	XX
end	XX
of	XX
each	XX
year	XX
,	XX
the	XX
volunteers	XX
would	XX
be	XX
making	XX
a	XX
wage	XX
comparable	XX
to	XX
$	XX
17,500	XX
a	XX
year	XX
.	XX

Mind	XX
you	XX
,	XX
most	XX
of	XX
``	XX

be	XX

18-year-olds	XX

some	XX
not	XX
even	XX
high	XX
school	XX
graduates	XX
,	XX
and	XX
many	XX
saving	XX
money	XX
by	XX
living	XX
at	XX
home	XX
.	XX

They	XX
would	XX
be	XX
doing	XX
better	XX
financially	XX
under	XX
national	XX
service	XX
than	XX
many	XX
taxpayers	XX
working	XX
at	XX
the	XX
same	XX
kinds	XX
of	XX
jobs	XX
and	XX
perhaps	XX
supporting	XX
families	XX
.	XX

As	XX
it	XX
happened	XX
,	XX
political	XX
resistance	XX
developed	XX
among	XX
educational	XX
and	XX
minority	XX
interests	XX
that	XX
count	XX
on	XX
the	XX
present	XX
education	XX
grant	XX
system	XX
,	XX
so	XX
the	XX
national-service	XX
devotees	XX
decided	XX
to	XX
abandon	XX
the	XX
supposedly	XX
crucial	XX
principle	XX
of	XX
``	XX
give	XX

which	XX
wants	XX

protect	XX

recruitment	XX
process	XX
,	XX
also	XX
led	XX
to	XX
the	XX
military-service	XX
option	XX
being	XX
dropped	XX
.	XX

Clearly	XX
,	XX
a	XX
new	XX
rationale	XX
for	XX
national	XX
service	XX
had	XX
to	XX
be	XX
cooked	XX
up	XX

want	XX
to	XX
support	XX
students	XX
,	XX
we	XX
might	XX
adopt	XX
the	XX
idea	XX
used	XX
in	XX
other	XX
countries	XX
of	XX
offering	XX
more	XX
scholarships	XX
based	XX
on	XX
something	XX
called	XX
``	XX
scholarship	XX
,	XX
''	XX
rather	XX
than	XX
on	XX
the	XX
government	XX
's	XX
idea	XX
of	XX
``	XX
service	XX
.	XX
''	XX

Or	XX
we	XX
might	XX
provide	XX
a	XX
tax	XX
credit	XX
for	XX
working	XX
students	XX
.	XX

What	XX
we	XX
do	XX
not	XX
need	XX
to	XX
do	XX
is	XX
start	XX
a	XX
war	XX
,	XX
and	XX
then	XX
try	XX
to	XX
justify	XX
it	XX
by	XX
creating	XX
a	XX
GI	XX
Bill	XX
.	XX

To	XX
the	XX
extent	XX
we	XX
lack	XX
manpower	XX
to	XX
staff	XX
menial	XX
jobs	XX
in	XX
hospitals	XX
,	XX
for	XX
example	XX
,	XX
we	XX
should	XX
raise	XX
pay	XX
,	XX
pursue	XX
labor-saving	XX

allow	XX
more	XX
legal	XX

rather	XX
than	XX
overpay	XX
high	XX

resentment	XX
among	XX
permanent	XX

paid	XX
lesser	XX

do	XX
the	XX

Will	XX
national	XX

in	XX
the	XX
current	XX
highly	XX
politicized	XX
and	XX
opportunistic	XX
form	XX
exert	XX
enough	XX
appeal	XX
to	XX
get	XX
adopted	XX
?	XX

Not	XX
necessarily	XX
.	XX

Polls	XX
show	XX
wide	XX
,	XX
generalized	XX
support	XX
for	XX
some	XX
vague	XX
concept	XX
of	XX
service	XX
,	XX
but	XX
the	XX
bill	XX
now	XX
under	XX
discussion	XX
lacks	XX
any	XX
passionate	XX
public	XX
backing	XX
.	XX

Nonetheless	XX
,	XX
Senate	XX

are	XX
organizing	XX
a	XX
roll	XX
of	XX
supporting	XX
``	XX
associations	XX

``	XX

some	XX
of	XX
which	XX
may	XX
hope	XX
to	XX
receive	XX
the	XX
paid	XX
``	XX

''	XX

So	XX
far	XX
,	XX
the	XX
president	XX
seems	XX
ill-disposed	XX
to	XX
substitute	XX
any	XX
of	XX
the	XX
omnibus	XX
for	XX
his	XX
own	XX
free-standing	XX
proposal	XX
to	XX
endow	XX

inform	XX
citizens	XX

all	XX

and	XX
exhort	XX
them	XX
to	XX
genuine	XX
volunteerism	XX
.	XX

However	XX
,	XX
even	XX
this	XX
admirable	XX
plan	XX
could	XX
become	XX
objectionable	XX
if	XX
the	XX
White	XX
House	XX
gives	XX

add	XX

is	XX
one	XX
to	XX
think	XX
of	XX
all	XX

Doctrine	XX

responses	XX

their	XX
dues	XX
to	XX
society	XX
''	XX
favor	XX
service	XX
proposals	XX
--	XX
preferably	XX
mandatory	XX
ones	XX
.	XX

So	XX
do	XX
those	XX
who	XX
seek	XX
a	XX
``	XX
re-energized	XX
concept	XX
of	XX
citizenship	XX
,	XX
''	XX
a	XX
concept	XX
imposing	XX
stern	XX
obligations	XX
as	XX
well	XX
as	XX
conferring	XX
rights	XX
.	XX

Then	XX
there	XX
are	XX
instinctive	XX
opponents	XX
.	XX

To	XX
libertarians	XX
,	XX
mandatory	XX
service	XX
is	XX
an	XX
abomination	XX
and	XX
voluntary	XX
systems	XX
are	XX
illegitimate	XX
uses	XX
of	XX
tax	XX
money	XX
.	XX

Devotees	XX
of	XX
the	XX
market	XX
question	XX
the	XX
value	XX
of	XX
the	XX
work	XX
national	XX
service	XX
would	XX
perform	XX
:	XX

If	XX
the	XX
market	XX
wo	XX
n't	XX
pay	XX
for	XX
it	XX
,	XX
they	XX
argue	XX
,	XX
it	XX
ca	XX
n't	XX
be	XX
worth	XX
its	XX
cost	XX
.	XX

Elements	XX
of	XX
the	XX
left	XX
are	XX
also	XX
reflexively	XX
opposed	XX
;	XX
they	XX
see	XX
service	XX
as	XX
a	XX
cover	XX
for	XX
the	XX
draft	XX
,	XX
or	XX
fear	XX
the	XX
regimentation	XX
of	XX
youth	XX
,	XX
or	XX
want	XX
to	XX
see	XX
rights	XX
enlarged	XX
,	XX
not	XX
obligations	XX
.	XX

But	XX
what	XX
about	XX
those	XX
of	XX
us	XX
whose	XX
views	XX
are	XX
not	XX
predetermined	XX
by	XX
formula	XX
or	XX
ideology	XX
?	XX

How	XX
should	XX
we	XX
think	XX
about	XX
national	XX
service	XX
?	XX

Let	XX
's	XX
begin	XX
by	XX
recognizing	XX
a	XX
main	XX
source	XX
of	XX
confusion	XX
--	XX
``	XX
national	XX
service	XX
''	XX
has	XX
no	XX
agreed	XX
meaning	XX
.	XX

Would	XX
service	XX
be	XX
voluntary	XX
or	XX
compulsory	XX
?	XX

Short	XX
or	XX
long	XX
?	XX

Part-time	XX
or	XX
full-time	XX
?	XX

Paid	XX
or	XX
unpaid	XX
?	XX

Would	XX
participants	XX
live	XX
at	XX
home	XX
and	XX
work	XX
nearby	XX
or	XX
live	XX
in	XX
barracks	XX
and	XX
work	XX
on	XX
public	XX
lands	XX
?	XX

What	XX
kinds	XX
of	XX
work	XX
would	XX
they	XX
do	XX
?	XX

What	XX
does	XX
``	XX
national	XX
''	XX
mean	XX
?	XX

Would	XX
the	XX
program	XX
be	XX
run	XX
by	XX
the	XX
federal	XX
government	XX
,	XX
by	XX
local	XX
governments	XX
,	XX
or	XX
by	XX
private	XX
voluntary	XX
organizations	XX
?	XX

And	XX
who	XX
would	XX
serve	XX
?	XX

Only	XX
males	XX
,	XX
as	XX
with	XX
the	XX
draft	XX
,	XX
or	XX
both	XX
sexes	XX
?	XX

Youth	XX
only	XX
or	XX
all	XX
ages	XX
?	XX

Middle-class	XX
people	XX
,	XX
or	XX
poor	XX
people	XX
,	XX
or	XX
a	XX
genuine	XX
cross-section	XX
?	XX

Many	XX
or	XX
few	XX
?	XX

Those	XX
are	XX
not	XX
trivial	XX
questions	XX
,	XX
and	XX
the	XX
label	XX
``	XX
national	XX
service	XX
''	XX
answers	XX
none	XX
of	XX
them	XX
.	XX

Then	XX
how	XX
should	XX
we	XX
think	XX
about	XX
national	XX
service	XX
?	XX

As	XX
a	XX
starting	XX
point	XX
,	XX
here	XX
are	XX
five	XX
propositions	XX
:	XX
1	XX
.	XX
Consider	XX
the	XX
ingredients	XX
,	XX
not	XX
the	XX
name	XX
.	XX

Ignore	XX
``	XX
national	XX
service	XX
''	XX
in	XX
the	XX
abstract	XX
;	XX
consider	XX
specific	XX
proposals	XX
.	XX

They	XX
will	XX
differ	XX
in	XX
crucial	XX
ways	XX
.	XX

2	XX
.	XX
``	XX
Service	XX
''	XX
should	XX
be	XX
service	XX
.	XX

As	XX
commonly	XX
understood	XX
,	XX
service	XX
implies	XX
sacrifice	XX
.	XX

It	XX
involves	XX
accepting	XX
risk	XX
,	XX
or	XX
giving	XX
up	XX
income	XX
,	XX
or	XX
deferring	XX
a	XX
career	XX
.	XX

It	XX
follows	XX
that	XX
proposals	XX
like	XX
Nunn-McCurdy	XX
,	XX
whose	XX
benefits	XX
to	XX
enrollees	XX
are	XX
worth	XX
some	XX
$	XX
17,500	XX
a	XX
year	XX
,	XX
do	XX
not	XX
qualify	XX
.	XX

There	XX
is	XX
a	XX
rationale	XX
for	XX
such	XX
bills	XX
:	XX
Federal	XX
subsidies	XX
to	XX
college	XX
students	XX
amount	XX
to	XX
``	XX
a	XX
GI	XX
Bill	XX
without	XX
the	XX
GI	XX
''	XX
;	XX
arguably	XX
those	XX
benefits	XX
should	XX
be	XX
earned	XX
,	XX
not	XX
given	XX
.	XX

But	XX
the	XX
earnings	XX
exceed	XX
by	XX
20	XX
%	XX
the	XX
average	XX
income	XX
of	XX
young	XX
high-school	XX
graduates	XX
with	XX
full-time	XX
jobs	XX
.	XX

Why	XX
call	XX
that	XX
service	XX
?	XX

3	XX
.	XX
Encouragement	XX
is	XX
fine	XX
;	XX
compulsion	XX
is	XX
not	XX
.	XX

Compelled	XX
service	XX
is	XX
unconstitutional	XX
.	XX

It	XX
is	XX
also	XX
unwise	XX
and	XX
unenforceable	XX
.	XX

-LRB-	XX
Who	XX
will	XX
throw	XX
several	XX
hundred	XX
thousand	XX
refusers	XX
in	XX
jail	XX
each	XX
year	XX
?	XX
-RRB-	XX

But	XX
through	XX
tax	XX
policy	XX
and	XX
in	XX
other	XX
ways	XX
the	XX
federal	XX
government	XX
encourages	XX
many	XX
kinds	XX
of	XX
behavior	XX
.	XX

It	XX
should	XX
also	XX
encourage	XX
service	XX
--	XX
preferably	XX
by	XX
all	XX
classes	XX
and	XX
all	XX
ages	XX
.	XX

Its	XX
encouragement	XX
should	XX
strengthen	XX
and	XX
not	XX
undercut	XX
the	XX
strong	XX
tradition	XX
of	XX
volunteering	XX
in	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX
,	XX
should	XX
build	XX
on	XX
the	XX
service	XX
programs	XX
already	XX
in	XX
existence	XX
,	XX
and	XX
should	XX
honor	XX
local	XX
convictions	XX
about	XX
which	XX
tasks	XX
most	XX
need	XX
doing	XX
.	XX

4	XX
.	XX
Good	XX
programs	XX
are	XX
not	XX
cheap	XX
.	XX

Enthusiasts	XX
assume	XX
that	XX
national	XX
service	XX
would	XX
get	XX
important	XX
work	XX
done	XX
cheaply	XX
:	XX
forest	XX
fires	XX

Federal	XX
Reserve	XX
Chairman	XX
Alan	XX

was	XX
on	XX
the	XX
telephones	XX
,	XX
making	XX
it	XX
clear	XX
to	XX
officials	XX
in	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX

abroad	XX
that	XX
the	XX

was	XX
prepared	XX
to	XX
inject	XX
massive	XX
amounts	XX
of	XX
money	XX
into	XX
the	XX

carefully	XX
analyzed	XX

the	XX

feared	XX

In	XX
addition	XX

officials	XX
at	XX
the	XX

in	XX
the	XX
Bush	XX

decided	XX
that	XX
avoiding	XX

actions	XX

over	XX

would	XX
give	XX

more	XX

``	XX

The	XX
Fed	XX
's	XX
efforts	XX
at	XX

were	XX
partly	XX
foiled	XX

morning	XX
,	XX
when	XX
both	XX
the	XX

insisted	XX

had	XX

today	XX

And	XX
investment	XX
pros	XX
are	XX
divided	XX
on	XX
whether	XX
stocks	XX
will	XX
perform	XX
well	XX
or	XX
badly	XX
in	XX
the	XX
next	XX
six	XX
months	XX
.	XX

But	XX
they	XX
're	XX
nearly	XX
unanimous	XX
on	XX
one	XX
point	XX
:	XX
Do	XX
n't	XX
sell	XX
into	XX
a	XX
panic	XX
.	XX

Investors	XX
who	XX
sold	XX
everything	XX
after	XX
the	XX
crash	XX
of	XX
1987	XX
lived	XX
to	XX
regret	XX
it	XX
.	XX

Even	XX
after	XX
Friday	XX
's	XX
plunge	XX
,	XX
the	XX
Dow	XX
Jones	XX
Industrial	XX
Average	XX
was	XX
48	XX
%	XX
above	XX
where	XX
it	XX
landed	XX
on	XX
Oct.	XX
19	XX
two	XX
years	XX
ago	XX
.	XX

Panic	XX
selling	XX
also	XX
was	XX
unwise	XX
during	XX
other	XX
big	XX
declines	XX
in	XX
the	XX
past	XX
.	XX

The	XX
crash	XX
of	XX
1929	XX
was	XX
followed	XX
by	XX
a	XX
substantial	XX
recovery	XX
before	XX
the	XX
great	XX
Depression	XX
and	XX
awful	XX
bear	XX
market	XX
of	XX
the	XX
1930s	XX
began	XX
.	XX

The	XX
``	XX
October	XX
massacres	XX
''	XX
of	XX
1978	XX
and	XX
1979	XX
were	XX
scary	XX
,	XX
but	XX
did	XX
n't	XX
lead	XX
to	XX
severe	XX
or	XX
sustained	XX
downturns	XX
.	XX

Indeed	XX
,	XX
some	XX
pros	XX
see	XX
Friday	XX

,	XX
plus	XX
any	XX
further	XX
damage	XX
that	XX
might	XX
occur	XX
early	XX

has	XX
been	XX

strategy	XX
for	XX

is	XX
to	XX

until	XX
the	XX

Whether	XX
this	XX
insurance	XX
is	XX
worthwhile	XX
depends	XX
on	XX
the	XX
cost	XX
of	XX
an	XX
option	XX
.	XX

The	XX
cost	XX
,	XX
or	XX
premium	XX
,	XX
tends	XX
to	XX
get	XX
fat	XX
in	XX
times	XX
of	XX
crisis	XX
.	XX

Thus	XX
,	XX
buying	XX
puts	XX
after	XX
a	XX
big	XX
market	XX
slide	XX
can	XX
be	XX
an	XX
expensive	XX
way	XX
to	XX
hedge	XX
against	XX
risk	XX
.	XX

The	XX
prices	XX
of	XX
puts	XX
generally	XX
did	XX
n't	XX
soar	XX
Friday	XX

For	XX
example	XX
,	XX
the	XX

close	XX

even	XX
though	XX
the	XX
shares	XX

But	XX
put-option	XX
prices	XX
may	XX
zoom	XX
when	XX
trading	XX
resumes	XX
today	XX

It	XX
's	XX
hard	XX
to	XX
generalize	XX
about	XX
a	XX
reasonable	XX
price	XX
for	XX
puts	XX
.	XX

But	XX
investors	XX
should	XX
keep	XX
in	XX
mind	XX
,	XX
before	XX
paying	XX
too	XX
much	XX
,	XX
that	XX
the	XX
average	XX
annual	XX
return	XX
for	XX

a	XX
year	XX

a	XX
return	XX

move	XX
equal	XX
to	XX
40	XX
points	XX
on	XX
the	XX
Dow	XX

.	XX

The	XX
aim	XX
of	XX
the	XX
interruption	XX
would	XX
be	XX
to	XX
ease	XX
the	XX
opening	XX
of	XX
the	XX
New	XX

,	XX
which	XX
would	XX
be	XX
hammered	XX
by	XX
such	XX
a	XX
volatile	XX
move	XX

the	XX

That	XX
early-morning	XX
breather	XX
is	XX
just	XX
one	XX
of	XX
a	XX
number	XX
of	XX
safeguards	XX
adopted	XX
after	XX
the	XX
1987	XX
crash	XX
.	XX

The	XX
Big	XX

Several	XX
of	XX
those	XX
post-crash	XX
changes	XX
kicked	XX
in	XX
during	XX
Friday	XX
's	XX
one-hour	XX
collapse	XX
and	XX
worked	XX
as	XX
expected	XX
,	XX
even	XX
though	XX
they	XX
did	XX
n't	XX
prevent	XX
a	XX
stunning	XX
plunge	XX

But	XX
the	XX
major	XX
``	XX

''	XX
have	XX
yet	XX
to	XX
be	XX
evaluated	XX
.	XX

A	XX
deeper	XX
market	XX
plunge	XX
today	XX
could	XX
give	XX
them	XX
their	XX
first	XX
test	XX
.	XX

A	XX
further	XX
slide	XX
also	XX
would	XX
resurrect	XX
debate	XX
over	XX
a	XX
host	XX
of	XX
other	XX
,	XX
more	XX
sweeping	XX
changes	XX
proposed	XX
--	XX

not	XX

because	XX

The	XX
most	XX
controversial	XX
of	XX
the	XX
Brady	XX
recommendations	XX
involved	XX
establishing	XX
a	XX
single	XX
overarching	XX
regulator	XX

handle	XX
crucial	XX
cross-market	XX

such	XX
as	XX
setting	XX

for	XX
the	XX

for	XX
the	XX
moment	XX
,	XX
attention	XX
focuses	XX
on	XX
the	XX
reforms	XX
that	XX
were	XX
put	XX

The	XX
MMI	XX

the	XX
S&P	XX

are	XX
the	XX
two	XX
major	XX
indexes	XX
used	XX
by	XX
program	XX
traders	XX
to	XX
run	XX
their	XX
computerized	XX
trading	XX
strategies	XX
.	XX

The	XX
programs	XX
are	XX
considered	XX
by	XX
many	XX
to	XX
be	XX
a	XX
major	XX
cause	XX
of	XX
the	XX
1987	XX
crash	XX
.	XX

The	XX
process	XX
of	XX
post-crash	XX
reforms	XX
began	XX
with	XX
calls	XX
to	XX
remake	XX
the	XX
markets	XX
and	XX
wound	XX
up	XX
a	XX
year	XX
later	XX
with	XX
a	XX
series	XX
of	XX
rather	XX
technical	XX
adjustments	XX
.	XX

In	XX
October	XX
1987	XX
,	XX
just	XX
after	XX
the	XX
market	XX
drop	XX
,	XX
Washington	XX
was	XX
awash	XX
in	XX
talk	XX
of	XX
sweeping	XX
changes	XX
in	XX
the	XX
way	XX
the	XX
financial	XX
markets	XX
are	XX
structured	XX
and	XX
regulated	XX
.	XX

Over	XX
the	XX
next	XX
year	XX
that	XX
grand	XX
agenda	XX
was	XX
whittled	XX
down	XX
to	XX
a	XX
series	XX
of	XX
steps	XX
to	XX
soften	XX
big	XX
stock	XX
drops	XX
by	XX
interrupting	XX
trading	XX
to	XX
give	XX
market	XX
players	XX
time	XX
to	XX
pause	XX
and	XX
reconsider	XX
positions	XX
.	XX

In	XX
addition	XX
,	XX
limits	XX
were	XX
placed	XX
on	XX
computer-driven	XX
trading	XX
,	XX
and	XX
steps	XX
were	XX
taken	XX
to	XX
better	XX
link	XX
the	XX
stock	XX
and	XX
futures	XX
markets	XX
.	XX

Few	XX
changes	XX
were	XX
made	XX
in	XX
the	XX
way	XX
the	XX
markets	XX
are	XX
regulated	XX
.	XX

At	XX
the	XX
outset	XX
the	XX
prime	XX
target	XX
was	XX
program	XX
trading	XX
,	XX
which	XX
was	XX
much	XX
discussed	XX
but	XX
little	XX
understood	XX
on	XX
Capitol	XX
Hill	XX
.	XX

There	XX
were	XX
also	XX
calls	XX
to	XX
strip	XX
the	XX
stock	XX
markets	XX
of	XX
``	XX
derivative	XX
''	XX
products	XX
,	XX
such	XX
as	XX
stock-index	XX
futures	XX
and	XX
options	XX
,	XX
which	XX
Federal	XX
Judge	XX
Stanley	XX
Sporkin	XX
,	XX
for	XX
example	XX
,	XX
likened	XX
to	XX
``	XX
barnacles	XX
attached	XX
to	XX
the	XX
basic	XX
market	XX
.	XX
''	XX

And	XX
there	XX
was	XX
much	XX
criticism	XX
of	XX
the	XX
New	XX
York	XX
Stock	XX
Exchange	XX
's	XX
system	XX
of	XX
having	XX
stock	XX
trades	XX
flow	XX
through	XX
specialists	XX
,	XX
or	XX
market	XX
makers	XX
.	XX

When	XX
the	XX

powerful	XX
analysis	XX
of	XX
the	XX
crash	XX
was	XX
released	XX
in	XX
January	XX
1988	XX
,	XX
it	XX
immediately	XX
reshaped	XX
the	XX
reformers	XX
'	XX
agenda	XX
.	XX

Arguing	XX
that	XX
the	XX
separate	XX
financial	XX
marketplaces	XX
acted	XX
as	XX
one	XX
,	XX
and	XX
concluding	XX
that	XX
the	XX
crash	XX
had	XX
``	XX
raised	XX
the	XX
possibility	XX
of	XX
a	XX
full-scale	XX
financial	XX
system	XX
breakdown	XX
,	XX
''	XX
the	XX
presidential	XX
task	XX
force	XX
called	XX
for	XX
establishing	XX
a	XX
super-regulator	XX
to	XX
oversee	XX
the	XX

to	XX
make	XX
margins	XX

to	XX
unify	XX

to	XX
install	XX
circuit	XX

Only	XX
the	XX
last	XX
of	XX
those	XX
recommendations	XX
ever	XX
was	XX
implemented	XX

The	XX
Reagan	XX

held	XX
the	XX

Mr.	XX

Sony	XX

it	XX
has	XX
spent	XX
more	XX

3	XX

Sony	XX
found	XX
a	XX
new	XX
market	XX

,	XX

Mr.	XX

figured	XX
that	XX
its	XX
prices	XX
left	XX
plenty	XX

room	XX
for	XX
a	XX
lower-priced	XX
competitor	XX

His	XX

are	XX
n't	XX
exact	XX
copies	XX
of	XX

strongly	XX
resemble	XX
them	XX
in	XX
size	XX

shape	XX

,	XX
especially	XX

color	XX

Sony	XX
uses	XX

Friday	XX
's	XX
190-point	XX
plunge	XX
in	XX

does	XX
not	XX
come	XX
atop	XX
the	XX
climate	XX

anxiety	XX

dominated	XX

just	XX
prior	XX

their	XX
1987	XX

and	XX
mechanisms	XX
have	XX
been	XX
put	XX
in	XX
place	XX
to	XX
keep	XX
markets	XX
more	XX
orderly	XX
.	XX

Still	XX
,	XX
the	XX
lesson	XX
is	XX
about	XX
the	XX
same	XX
:	XX
On	XX
Friday	XX
the	XX
13th	XX
,	XX
the	XX
market	XX
was	XX
spooked	XX
by	XX
Washington	XX
.	XX

The	XX
consensus	XX
along	XX
the	XX
street	XX
seems	XX
to	XX
be	XX
that	XX
the	XX
plunge	XX
was	XX
triggered	XX
by	XX
the	XX
financing	XX
problems	XX
of	XX
the	XX
UAL	XX
takeover	XX
,	XX
and	XX
it	XX
's	XX
certainly	XX
true	XX
the	XX
rout	XX
began	XX
immediately	XX
after	XX
the	XX
UAL	XX
trading	XX
halt	XX
.	XX

Still	XX
,	XX
the	XX
consensus	XX
seems	XX
almost	XX
as	XX
wide	XX
that	XX
one	XX
faltering	XX
bid	XX
is	XX
no	XX
reason	XX
to	XX
write	XX
down	XX
the	XX
value	XX
of	XX
all	XX
U.S.	XX
business	XX
.	XX

This	XX
observation	XX
leads	XX
us	XX
to	XX
another	XX
piece	XX
of	XX
news	XX
moving	XX
on	XX
the	XX
Dow	XX
Jones	XX
ticker	XX
shortly	XX
before	XX
the	XX
downturn	XX
:	XX
the	XX
success	XX
of	XX
Senate	XX
Democrats	XX
in	XX
stalling	XX
the	XX
capital	XX
gains	XX
tax	XX
cut	XX
.	XX

The	XX
real	XX
value	XX
of	XX
all	XX
shares	XX
,	XX
after	XX
all	XX
,	XX
is	XX
directly	XX
impacted	XX
by	XX
the	XX
tax	XX
on	XX
any	XX
profits	XX
-LRB-	XX
all	XX
the	XX
more	XX
so	XX
given	XX
the	XX
limits	XX
on	XX
deductions	XX
for	XX
losses	XX
that	XX
show	XX
gains	XX
are	XX
not	XX
``	XX
ordinary	XX
income	XX
''	XX
-RRB-	XX
.	XX

And	XX
market	XX
expectations	XX
clearly	XX
have	XX
been	XX
raised	XX
by	XX
the	XX
capital	XX
gains	XX
victory	XX
in	XX
the	XX
House	XX
last	XX
month	XX
.	XX

An	XX
hour	XX
before	XX
Friday	XX
's	XX
plunge	XX
,	XX
that	XX
provision	XX
was	XX
stripped	XX
from	XX
the	XX
tax	XX
bill	XX
,	XX
leaving	XX
it	XX
with	XX
$	XX
5.4	XX
billion	XX
in	XX
tax	XX
increases	XX
without	XX
a	XX
capital	XX
gains	XX
cut	XX
.	XX

There	XX
is	XX
a	XX
great	XX
deal	XX
to	XX
be	XX
said	XX
,	XX
to	XX
be	XX
sure	XX
,	XX
for	XX
stripping	XX
the	XX
garbage	XX
out	XX
of	XX
the	XX
reconciliation	XX
bill	XX
.	XX

It	XX
would	XX
be	XX
a	XX
good	XX
thing	XX
if	XX
Congress	XX
started	XX
to	XX
decide	XX
issues	XX
one-by-one	XX
on	XX
their	XX
individual	XX
merits	XX
without	XX
trickery	XX
.	XX

For	XX
one	XX
thing	XX
,	XX
no	XX
one	XX
doubts	XX
that	XX
the	XX
capital	XX
gains	XX
cut	XX
would	XX
pass	XX
on	XX
an	XX
up-or-down	XX
vote	XX
.	XX

Since	XX
Senate	XX
leaders	XX
have	XX
so	XX
far	XX
fogged	XX
it	XX
up	XX
with	XX
procedural	XX
smokescreens	XX
,	XX
promises	XX
of	XX
a	XX
cleaner	XX
bill	XX
are	XX
suspect	XX
.	XX

Especially	XX
so	XX
since	XX
President	XX
Bush	XX
has	XX
been	XX
weakened	XX
by	XX
the	XX
Panama	XX
fiasco	XX
.	XX

To	XX
the	XX
extent	XX
that	XX
the	XX
UAL	XX
troubles	XX
contributed	XX
to	XX
the	XX
plunge	XX
,	XX
they	XX
are	XX
another	XX
instance	XX
of	XX
Washington	XX
's	XX
sticky	XX
fingers	XX
.	XX

As	XX
the	XX
best	XX
opportunities	XX
for	XX
corporate	XX
restructurings	XX
are	XX
exhausted	XX
of	XX
course	XX
,	XX
at	XX
some	XX
point	XX
the	XX
market	XX
will	XX
start	XX
to	XX
reject	XX
them	XX
.	XX

But	XX
the	XX
airlines	XX
are	XX
scarcely	XX
a	XX
clear	XX
case	XX
,	XX
given	XX
anti-takeover	XX
mischief	XX
by	XX
Secretary	XX
of	XX
Transportation	XX
Skinner	XX
,	XX
who	XX
professes	XX
to	XX
believe	XX
safety	XX
will	XX
be	XX
compromised	XX
if	XX
KLM	XX
and	XX
British	XX
Airways	XX
own	XX
interests	XX
in	XX
companies	XX
that	XX
fly	XX
airplanes	XX
.	XX

Worse	XX
,	XX
Congress	XX
has	XX
started	XX
to	XX
jump	XX
on	XX
the	XX
Skinner	XX
bandwagon	XX
.	XX

James	XX
Oberstar	XX
,	XX
the	XX
Minnesota	XX
Democrat	XX
who	XX
chairs	XX
the	XX
Public	XX
Works	XX
and	XX
Transportation	XX
Committee	XX
's	XX
aviation	XX
subcommittee	XX
,	XX
has	XX
put	XX
an	XX
anti-airline	XX
takeover	XX
bill	XX
on	XX
supersonic	XX
speed	XX
so	XX
that	XX
it	XX
would	XX
be	XX
passed	XX
in	XX
time	XX
to	XX
affect	XX
the	XX
American	XX
and	XX
United	XX
Air	XX
Lines	XX
bids	XX
.	XX

It	XX
would	XX
give	XX
Mr.	XX
Skinner	XX
up	XX
to	XX
50	XX
days	XX
to	XX
``	XX
review	XX
''	XX
any	XX
bid	XX
for	XX
15	XX
%	XX
or	XX
more	XX
of	XX
the	XX
voting	XX
stock	XX
of	XX
any	XX
U.S.	XX
carrier	XX
with	XX
revenues	XX
of	XX
$	XX
1	XX
billion	XX
or	XX
more	XX
.	XX

So	XX
the	XX
UAL	XX
deal	XX
has	XX
problems	XX
,	XX
and	XX
the	XX
market	XX
loses	XX
190	XX
points	XX

there	XX
is	XX

one	XX
bright	XX
sign	XX
:	XX
The	XX
scandals	XX
still	XX
encircling	XX
former	XX
Prime	XX
Minister	XX
Andreas	XX
Papandreou	XX
and	XX
his	XX
fallen	XX
socialist	XX

are	XX
like	XX
flies	XX

gave	XX

.	XX

The	XX
ad	XX
interim	XX
coalition	XX
government	XX
that	XX
emerged	XX
from	XX
post-electoral	XX
hagglings	XX
was	XX
,	XX
in	XX
essence	XX
,	XX
little	XX
more	XX
than	XX
the	XX
ill-conceived	XX
offspring	XX
of	XX
ideological	XX
miscegenation	XX
:	XX
On	XX
one	XX
side	XX

headed	XX

On	XX
the	XX
other	XX
,	XX
the	XX
so-called	XX
Coalition	XX
of	XX
the	XX
Left	XX
and	XX
Progress	XX
--	XX
a	XX
quaint	XX
and	XX
rather	XX
deceptive	XX
title	XX
for	XX
a	XX
merger	XX
of	XX
the	XX
pro-Soviet	XX
Communist	XX
Party	XX
of	XX
Greece	XX
and	XX
its	XX
Euro-Communist	XX
cousin	XX
,	XX
the	XX
Hellenic	XX
Left	XX
.	XX

The	XX
unifying	XX
bond	XX
for	XX
this	XX
left-right	XX
mismatch	XX
was	XX
plain	XX
:	XX
PASOK	XX
-LRB-	XX
Mr.	XX
Papandreou	XX
's	XX
party	XX
-RRB-	XX
as	XX
common	XX
political	XX
enemy	XX
.	XX

The	XX
ostensible	XX
goal	XX
was	XX
a	XX
mop-up	XX
of	XX
government	XX
corruption	XX
,	XX
purportedly	XX
at	XX
all	XX
levels	XX
,	XX
but	XX
the	XX
main	XX
marks	XX
were	XX
Mr.	XX
Papandreou	XX
and	XX
his	XX
closest	XX
associates	XX
.	XX

In	XX
point	XX
of	XX
fact	XX
,	XX
this	XX
catharsis	XX
was	XX
overdue	XX
by	XX
decades	XX
.	XX

When	XX
reduced	XX
to	XX
buzzword	XX
status	XX
in	XX
ex	XX
parte	XX
pledges	XX
,	XX
however	XX
,	XX
the	XX
notion	XX
transmogrified	XX
into	XX
a	XX
promised	XX
assault	XX
,	XX
with	XX
targets	XX
primarily	XX
for	XX
political	XX
gains	XX
,	XX
not	XX
justice	XX
.	XX

With	XX
regard	XX
to	XX
Greece	XX
's	XX
long-bubbling	XX
bank-looting	XX
scandal	XX
,	XX
Mr.	XX
Papandreou	XX
's	XX
principal	XX
accuser	XX
remains	XX
George	XX
Koskotas	XX
,	XX
former	XX
owner	XX
of	XX
the	XX
Bank	XX
of	XX
Crete	XX
and	XX
self-confessed	XX
embezzler	XX
,	XX
now	XX
residing	XX
in	XX
a	XX
jail	XX
cell	XX
in	XX
Salem	XX
,	XX
Mass.	XX
,	XX
from	XX
where	XX
he	XX
is	XX
fighting	XX
extradition	XX
proceedings	XX
that	XX
would	XX
return	XX
him	XX
to	XX
Greece	XX
.	XX

Mr.	XX
Koskotas	XX
's	XX
credibility	XX
is	XX
,	XX
at	XX
best	XX
,	XX
problematic	XX
.	XX

He	XX
has	XX
ample	XX
motive	XX
to	XX
shift	XX
the	XX
blame	XX
,	XX
and	XX
his	XX
testimony	XX
has	XX
also	XX
been	XX
found	XX
less	XX
than	XX
forthright	XX
on	XX
numerous	XX
points	XX
.	XX

Nevertheless	XX
,	XX
the	XX
New	XX
Democracy	XX
and	XX
Communist	XX
parties	XX
herald	XX
his	XX
assertions	XX
as	XX
proof	XX
of	XX
PASOK	XX
complicity	XX
.	XX

Among	XX
unanswered	XX
questions	XX
are	XX
whether	XX
Mr.	XX
Papandreou	XX
received	XX
$	XX
23	XX
million	XX
of	XX
stolen	XX
Bank	XX
of	XX
Crete	XX
funds	XX
and	XX
an	XX
additional	XX
$	XX
734,000	XX
in	XX
bribes	XX
,	XX
as	XX
contended	XX
;	XX
whether	XX
the	XX
prime	XX
minister	XX
ordered	XX
state	XX
agencies	XX
to	XX
deposit	XX
some	XX
$	XX
57	XX
million	XX
in	XX
Mr.	XX
Koskotas	XX
's	XX
bank	XX
and	XX
then	XX
skim	XX
off	XX
the	XX
interest	XX
;	XX
and	XX
,	XX
what	XX
PASOK	XX
's	XX
cut	XX
was	XX
from	XX
the	XX
$	XX
210	XX
million	XX
Mr.	XX
Koskotas	XX
pinched	XX
.	XX

Two	XX
former	XX
ministers	XX
were	XX
so	XX
heavily	XX
implicated	XX
in	XX
the	XX
Koskotas	XX
affair	XX
that	XX
PASOK	XX
members	XX
of	XX
Parliament	XX
voted	XX
to	XX
refer	XX
them	XX
to	XX
the	XX
special	XX
court	XX
.	XX

But	XX
eluding	XX
parliamentary	XX
probe	XX
was	XX
the	XX
case	XX
of	XX
millions	XX
of	XX
drachmas	XX
Mr.	XX
Koskotas	XX
funneled	XX
into	XX
New	XX
Democracy	XX
coffers	XX
.	XX

In	XX
the	XX
end	XX
,	XX
the	XX
investigation	XX
produced	XX
only	XX
circumstantial	XX
evidence	XX
and	XX
``	XX
indications	XX
''	XX
that	XX
point	XX
to	XX
PASOK	XX
,	XX
not	XX
clinching	XX
proof	XX
.	XX

On	XX
another	XX
issue	XX
,	XX
Greeks	XX
were	XX
told	XX
how	XX
their	XX
national	XX
intelligence	XX
agency	XX
,	XX
the	XX
EYP	XX
,	XX
regularly	XX
monitored	XX
the	XX
telephone	XX
conversations	XX
of	XX
prominent	XX
figures	XX
,	XX
including	XX
key	XX
opposition	XX
politicians	XX
,	XX
journalists	XX
and	XX
PASOK	XX
cabinet	XX
members	XX
.	XX

Despite	XX
convincing	XX
arguments	XX
,	XX
it	XX
was	XX
never	XX
established	XX
that	XX
Mr.	XX
Papandreou	XX
personally	XX
ordered	XX
or	XX
directed	XX
the	XX
wiretaps	XX
.	XX

The	XX
central	XX
weakness	XX
of	XX
the	XX
``	XX
scandals	XX
''	XX
debates	XX
was	XX
pointed	XX
up	XX
especially	XX
well	XX
when	XX
discussions	XX
focused	XX
on	XX
arms	XX
deals	XX
and	XX
kickbacks	XX
.	XX

The	XX
coalition	XX
government	XX
tried	XX
to	XX
show	XX
that	XX
PASOK	XX
ministers	XX
had	XX
received	XX
hefty	XX
sums	XX
for	XX
OKing	XX
the	XX
purchase	XX
of	XX
F-16	XX
Fighting	XX
Falcon	XX
and	XX
Mirage	XX
2000	XX
combat	XX
aircraft	XX
,	XX
produced	XX
by	XX
the	XX
U.S.based	XX
General	XX
Dynamics	XX
Corp.	XX
and	XX
France	XX
's	XX
Avions	XX
Marcel	XX
Dassault	XX
,	XX
respectively	XX
.	XX

Naturally	XX
,	XX
neither	XX
General	XX
Dynamics	XX
nor	XX
Dassault	XX
could	XX
be	XX
expected	XX
to	XX
hamper	XX
its	XX
prospective	XX
future	XX
dealings	XX
by	XX
making	XX
disclosures	XX
of	XX
sums	XX
paid	XX
-LRB-	XX
or	XX
not	XX
-RRB-	XX
to	XX
various	XX
Greek	XX
officials	XX
for	XX
services	XX
rendered	XX
.	XX

So	XX
it	XX
seems	XX
that	XX
Mr.	XX
Mitsotakis	XX
and	XX
his	XX
communist	XX
chums	XX
may	XX
have	XX
unwittingly	XX
served	XX
Mr.	XX
Papandreou	XX
a	XX
moral	XX
victory	XX
on	XX
a	XX
platter	XX
:	XX
PASOK	XX
,	XX
whether	XX
guilty	XX
or	XX
not	XX
,	XX
can	XX
now	XX
traipse	XX
the	XX
countryside	XX
condemning	XX
the	XX
whole	XX
affair	XX
as	XX
a	XX
witch	XX
hunt	XX
at	XX
Mr.	XX
Papandreou	XX
's	XX
expense	XX
.	XX

But	XX
while	XX
verbal	XX
high	XX
jinks	XX
alone	XX
wo	XX
n't	XX
help	XX
PASOK	XX
regain	XX
power	XX
,	XX
Mr.	XX
Papandreou	XX
should	XX
never	XX
be	XX
underestimated	XX
.	XX

First	XX
came	XX
his	XX
predictable	XX
fusillade	XX
:	XX
He	XX
charged	XX
the	XX
Coalition	XX
of	XX
the	XX
Left	XX
and	XX
Progress	XX
had	XX
sold	XX
out	XX
its	XX
leftist	XX
tenets	XX
by	XX
collaborating	XX
in	XX
a	XX
right-wing	XX
plot	XX
aimed	XX
at	XX
ousting	XX
PASOK	XX
and	XX
thwarting	XX
the	XX
course	XX
of	XX
socialism	XX
in	XX
Greece	XX
.	XX

Then	XX
,	XX
to	XX
buttress	XX
his	XX
credibility	XX
with	XX
the	XX
left	XX
,	XX
he	XX
enticed	XX
some	XX
smaller	XX
leftist	XX
parties	XX
to	XX
stand	XX
for	XX
election	XX
under	XX
the	XX
PASOK	XX
banner	XX
.	XX

Next	XX
,	XX
he	XX
continued	XX
to	XX
court	XX
the	XX
communists	XX
--	XX
many	XX
of	XX
whom	XX
feel	XX
betrayed	XX
by	XX
the	XX
left-right	XX
coalition	XX
's	XX
birth	XX
--	XX
by	XX
bringing	XX
into	XX
PASOK	XX
a	XX
well-respected	XX
Communist	XX
Party	XX
candidate	XX
.	XX

For	XX
balance	XX
,	XX
and	XX
in	XX
hopes	XX
of	XX
gaining	XX
some	XX
disaffected	XX
centrist	XX
votes	XX
,	XX
he	XX
managed	XX
to	XX
attract	XX
a	XX
former	XX
New	XX
Democracy	XX
Party	XX
representative	XX
and	XX
known	XX
political	XX
enemy	XX
of	XX
Mr.	XX
Mitsotakis	XX
.	XX

Thus	XX
PASOK	XX
heads	XX
for	XX
the	XX
polls	XX
not	XX
only	XX
with	XX
diminished	XX
scandal-stench	XX
,	XX
but	XX
also	XX
with	XX
``	XX
seals	XX
of	XX
approval	XX
''	XX
from	XX
representatives	XX
of	XX
its	XX
harshest	XX
accusers	XX
.	XX

Crucial	XX
as	XX
these	XX
elections	XX
are	XX
for	XX
Greece	XX
,	XX
pressing	XX
issues	XX
of	XX
state	XX
are	XX
getting	XX
lost	XX
in	XX
the	XX
shuffle	XX
.	XX

The	XX
country	XX
's	XX
future	XX
NATO	XX
participation	XX
remains	XX
unsure	XX
,	XX
for	XX
instance	XX
.	XX

Greece	XX
also	XX
must	XX
revamp	XX
major	XX
pieces	XX
of	XX
legislation	XX
in	XX
preparation	XX
for	XX
the	XX
1992	XX
targets	XX
of	XX
heightened	XX
Common	XX
Market	XX
cooperation	XX
.	XX

Greece	XX
's	XX
bilateral	XX
relations	XX
with	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX
need	XX
attention	XX
soon	XX
as	XX
well	XX
.	XX

For	XX
one	XX
,	XX
the	XX
current	XX
accord	XX
concerning	XX
U.S.	XX
military	XX
bases	XX
in	XX
Greece	XX
lapses	XX
in	XX
May	XX
1990	XX
.	XX

Negotiations	XX
for	XX
a	XX
new	XX
agreement	XX
were	XX
frozen	XX
before	XX
the	XX
June	XX
elections	XX
,	XX
but	XX
the	XX
clock	XX
is	XX
running	XX
.	XX

Another	XX
matter	XX
of	XX
concern	XX
is	XX
the	XX
extradition	XX
of	XX
Mohammed	XX
Rashid	XX
,	XX
a	XX
Palestinian	XX
terrorist	XX
who	XX
is	XX
wanted	XX
in	XX
the	XX
U.S.	XX
for	XX
the	XX
1982	XX
bombing	XX
of	XX
a	XX
Pan	XX
American	XX
Airways	XX
flight	XX
.	XX

The	XX
Greek	XX
courts	XX
have	XX
decided	XX
in	XX
favor	XX
of	XX
extradition	XX
in	XX
the	XX
Rashid	XX
case	XX
,	XX
but	XX
the	XX
matter	XX
awaits	XX
final	XX
approval	XX
from	XX
Greece	XX
's	XX
next	XX
justice	XX
minister	XX
.	XX

The	XX
Greeks	XX
seem	XX
barely	XX
aware	XX
of	XX
the	XX
importance	XX
of	XX
the	XX
case	XX
as	XX
a	XX
litmus	XX
test	XX
of	XX
whether	XX
Greece	XX
will	XX
be	XX
counted	XX
in	XX
or	XX
out	XX
for	XX
international	XX
efforts	XX
to	XX
combat	XX
terrorism	XX
.	XX

That	XX
PASOK	XX
could	XX
win	XX
the	XX
elections	XX
outright	XX
is	XX
improbable	XX
;	XX
the	XX
Greek	XX
press	XX
,	XX
previously	XX
eager	XX
to	XX
palm	XX
off	XX
PASOK	XX
's	XX
line	XX
,	XX
has	XX
turned	XX
on	XX
Mr.	XX
Papandreou	XX
with	XX
a	XX
wild-eyed	XX
vengeance	XX
.	XX

Yet	XX
the	XX
possibility	XX
of	XX
another	XX
lash-up	XX
government	XX
is	XX
all	XX
too	XX
real	XX
.	XX

If	XX
Mr.	XX
Papandreou	XX
becomes	XX
the	XX
major	XX
opposition	XX
leader	XX
,	XX
he	XX
could	XX
hamstring	XX
a	XX
conservative-led	XX
coalition	XX
.	XX

Also	XX
,	XX
he	XX
could	XX
force	XX
new	XX
elections	XX
early	XX
next	XX
year	XX
by	XX
frustrating	XX
the	XX
procedures	XX
for	XX
the	XX
election	XX
of	XX
the	XX
president	XX
of	XX
the	XX
republic	XX
in	XX
March	XX
.	XX

New	XX
Democracy	XX
has	XX
once	XX
again	XX
glaringly	XX
underestimated	XX
the	XX
opponent	XX
and	XX
linked	XX
its	XX
own	XX
prospects	XX
to	XX
negative	XX
reaction	XX
against	XX
PASOK	XX
,	XX

a	XX
1984	XX
suit	XX
filed	XX
by	XX
shareholders	XX
of	XX
Apple	XX

,	XX
claiming	XX
that	XX

misled	XX

about	XX
the	XX
expected	XX
success	XX
of	XX
the	XX
Lisa	XX
computer	XX

introduced	XX
in	XX
1983	XX

Lawyers	XX
specializing	XX

concerned	XX
that	XX
use	XX
of	XX
the	XX

''	XX
by	XX
corporations	XX
may	XX
become	XX
popular	XX
as	XX
a	XX
result	XX
of	XX
the	XX
ruling	XX
.	XX

According	XX
to	XX
the	XX
suit	XX
,	XX
Apple	XX
officials	XX
created	XX
public	XX
excitement	XX
by	XX
touting	XX
Lisa	XX
as	XX
an	XX
office	XX
computer	XX
that	XX
would	XX
revolutionize	XX
the	XX
workplace	XX
and	XX
be	XX
extremely	XX
successful	XX
in	XX
its	XX
first	XX
year	XX
.	XX

The	XX
plaintiffs	XX
also	XX
alleged	XX
that	XX
prior	XX
to	XX
the	XX
fanfare	XX
,	XX
the	XX
company	XX
circulated	XX
internal	XX
memos	XX
indicating	XX
problems	XX
with	XX
Lisa	XX
.	XX

The	XX
suit	XX
claimed	XX
Apple	XX
's	XX
stock	XX
climbed	XX
to	XX
a	XX
high	XX
of	XX
$	XX
63.50	XX
a	XX
share	XX
on	XX
the	XX
basis	XX
of	XX
the	XX
company	XX

But	XX
when	XX
the	XX
company	XX
revealed	XX
Lisa	XX
's	XX
poor	XX
sales	XX
late	XX
in	XX
1983	XX
,	XX
the	XX
stock	XX
plummeted	XX

a	XX

17.37	XX

shareholders	XX
claimed	XX
more	XX

$	XX
150	XX
million	XX
in	XX
losses	XX
.	XX

In	XX
1987	XX
,	XX
the	XX
San	XX
Francisco	XX
district	XX
court	XX
dismissed	XX
the	XX
case	XX
largely	XX
because	XX
newspaper	XX
reports	XX
had	XX
sufficiently	XX
counterbalanced	XX
the	XX
company	XX
's	XX
statements	XX
by	XX
alerting	XX
consumers	XX
to	XX
Lisa	XX
's	XX
problems	XX
.	XX

Late	XX
last	XX
month	XX
,	XX
the	XX
appeals	XX
court	XX
agreed	XX
that	XX
most	XX
of	XX
the	XX
case	XX
should	XX
be	XX
dismissed	XX
.	XX

However	XX
,	XX
it	XX
gave	XX
the	XX
shareholders	XX
the	XX
right	XX
to	XX
pursue	XX
a	XX
small	XX
portion	XX
of	XX
their	XX
claim	XX
that	XX
pertains	XX
to	XX
Lisa	XX
's	XX
disk	XX
drive	XX
,	XX
known	XX
as	XX
Twiggy	XX

The	XX
court	XX
ruled	XX
that	XX

did	XX
n't	XX
reveal	XX
Twiggy	XX
's	XX
problems	XX
at	XX

are	XX
worried	XX
about	XX
the	XX
ruling	XX
's	XX
implication	XX
in	XX
other	XX
shareholder	XX
suits	XX
but	XX
pointed	XX
out	XX
that	XX
the	XX
court	XX
stressed	XX
that	XX
the	XX

Why	XX
do	XX

In	XX
the	XX

Denver	XX
is	XX
another	XX
metropolitan	XX

where	XX
the	XX

has	XX
overreacted	XX

By	XX
some	XX
measures	XX
,	XX
metropolitan	XX
Denver	XX

has	XX
actually	XX
improved	XX

and	XX
this	XX
has	XX
resulted	XX
in	XX
a	XX

In	XX

Roe	XX

,	XX
recognizing	XX
a	XX

,	XX
was	XX
incorrect	XX
.	XX

He	XX
also	XX
argued	XX
that	XX
the	XX
high	XX
court	XX
was	XX
wrong	XX
in	XX
1976	XX
to	XX
rule	XX
that	XX
minors	XX

a	XX
right	XX
to	XX
abortion	XX

The	XX
administration	XX

The	XX
administration	XX
filed	XX
the	XX
brief	XX
in	XX
an	XX
appeal	XX
involving	XX
a	XX
Minnesota	XX
law	XX
that	XX
requires	XX
that	XX
both	XX
parents	XX
of	XX
a	XX
minor	XX
be	XX
notified	XX
before	XX
she	XX
may	XX
have	XX
an	XX
abortion	XX
.	XX

The	XX
administration	XX
urged	XX
the	XX
justices	XX
to	XX
adopt	XX
a	XX
legal	XX
standard	XX
suggested	XX
by	XX
Chief	XX
Justice	XX
William	XX
Rehnquist	XX
last	XX
July	XX
when	XX
the	XX
high	XX
court	XX
upheld	XX
Missouri	XX
's	XX
abortion	XX
restrictions	XX
.	XX

Under	XX
that	XX
standard	XX
,	XX
which	XX
garnered	XX
the	XX
votes	XX
of	XX
only	XX
three	XX
of	XX
the	XX
nine	XX
justices	XX
,	XX
a	XX
state	XX
restriction	XX
of	XX
abortion	XX
is	XX
constitutional	XX
if	XX
the	XX
state	XX
has	XX
a	XX
``	XX
reasonable	XX
''	XX
justification	XX
for	XX
adopting	XX
it	XX
.	XX

That	XX
is	XX
a	XX
much	XX
easier	XX
standard	XX
for	XX
a	XX
state	XX
to	XX
satisfy	XX
than	XX
the	XX
Supreme	XX
Court	XX
's	XX
test	XX
since	XX
1973	XX
,	XX
which	XX
requires	XX
a	XX
state	XX
to	XX
have	XX
a	XX
``	XX
compelling	XX
''	XX
reason	XX
for	XX
restricting	XX
abortion	XX
.	XX

On	XX
the	XX
provisions	XX
of	XX
the	XX
Minnesota	XX
law	XX
,	XX
the	XX
Bush	XX
administration	XX
said	XX
that	XX
requiring	XX
that	XX
both	XX
parents	XX
be	XX
notified	XX
is	XX
a	XX
reasonable	XX
regulation	XX
,	XX
and	XX
that	XX
there	XX
is	XX
no	XX
need	XX

For	XX
20	XX

And	XX
for	XX
six	XX

NBC	XX

have	XX
negotiated	XX
with	XX
Hollywood	XX

a	XX
futile	XX
attempt	XX

But	XX
with	XX

They	XX
hope	XX
the	XX
foreign	XX

will	XX
divide	XX

prod	XX

President	XX
F.W.	XX
de	XX
Klerk	XX
released	XX
the	XX
ANC	XX
men	XX
--	XX
along	XX
with	XX
one	XX
of	XX
the	XX
founding	XX
members	XX
of	XX
the	XX
Pan	XX
Africanist	XX
Congress	XX
,	XX
a	XX
rival	XX
liberation	XX
group	XX
--	XX
as	XX
part	XX
of	XX
his	XX
efforts	XX
to	XX
create	XX
a	XX
climate	XX
of	XX
trust	XX
and	XX
peace	XX
in	XX
which	XX
his	XX
government	XX
can	XX
begin	XX
negotiations	XX
with	XX
black	XX
leaders	XX
over	XX
a	XX
new	XX
constitution	XX
aimed	XX
at	XX
giving	XX
blacks	XX
a	XX
voice	XX
in	XX
national	XX
government	XX
.	XX

But	XX
Pretoria	XX
may	XX
instead	XX
be	XX
creating	XX
a	XX
climate	XX
for	XX
more	XX
turmoil	XX
and	XX
uncertainty	XX
in	XX
this	XX
racially	XX
divided	XX
country	XX
.	XX

As	XX
other	XX
repressive	XX
governments	XX
,	XX
particularly	XX
Poland	XX
and	XX
the	XX
Soviet	XX
Union	XX
,	XX
have	XX
recently	XX
discovered	XX
,	XX
initial	XX
steps	XX
to	XX
open	XX
up	XX
society	XX
can	XX
create	XX
a	XX
momentum	XX
for	XX
radical	XX
change	XX
that	XX
becomes	XX
difficult	XX
,	XX
if	XX
not	XX
impossible	XX
,	XX
to	XX
control	XX
.	XX

As	XX
the	XX
days	XX
go	XX
by	XX
,	XX
the	XX
South	XX
African	XX
government	XX
will	XX
be	XX
ever	XX
more	XX
hard	XX
pressed	XX
to	XX
justify	XX
the	XX
continued	XX
imprisonment	XX
of	XX
Mr.	XX
Mandela	XX
as	XX
well	XX
as	XX
the	XX
continued	XX
banning	XX
of	XX
the	XX
ANC	XX
and	XX
enforcement	XX
of	XX
the	XX
state	XX
of	XX
emergency	XX
.	XX

If	XX
it	XX
does	XX
n't	XX
yield	XX
on	XX
these	XX
matters	XX
,	XX
and	XX
eventually	XX
begin	XX
talking	XX
directly	XX
to	XX
the	XX
ANC	XX
,	XX
the	XX
expectations	XX
and	XX
promise	XX
raised	XX
by	XX
yesterday	XX
's	XX
releases	XX
will	XX
turn	XX
to	XX
disillusionment	XX
and	XX
unrest	XX
.	XX

If	XX
it	XX
does	XX
,	XX
the	XX
large	XX
number	XX
of	XX
right-wing	XX
whites	XX
,	XX
who	XX
oppose	XX
any	XX
concessions	XX
to	XX
the	XX
black	XX
majority	XX
,	XX
will	XX
step	XX
up	XX
their	XX
agitation	XX
and	XX
threats	XX
to	XX
take	XX
matters	XX
into	XX
their	XX
own	XX
hands	XX
.	XX

The	XX
newly	XX
released	XX
ANC	XX
leaders	XX
also	XX
will	XX
be	XX
under	XX
enormous	XX
pressure	XX
.	XX

The	XX
government	XX
is	XX
watching	XX
closely	XX
to	XX
see	XX
if	XX
their	XX
presence	XX
in	XX
the	XX
townships	XX
leads	XX
to	XX
increased	XX
anti-government	XX
protests	XX
and	XX
violence	XX
;	XX
if	XX
it	XX
does	XX
,	XX
Pretoria	XX
will	XX
use	XX
this	XX
as	XX
a	XX
reason	XX
to	XX
keep	XX
Mr.	XX
Mandela	XX
behind	XX
bars	XX
.	XX

Pretoria	XX
has	XX
n't	XX
forgotten	XX
why	XX
they	XX
were	XX
all	XX
sentenced	XX
to	XX
life	XX
imprisonment	XX
in	XX
the	XX
first	XX
place	XX
:	XX
for	XX
sabotage	XX
and	XX
conspiracy	XX
to	XX
overthrow	XX
the	XX
government	XX
.	XX

In	XX
addition	XX
,	XX
the	XX
government	XX
is	XX
figuring	XX
that	XX
the	XX
releases	XX
could	XX
create	XX
a	XX
split	XX
between	XX
the	XX
internal	XX
and	XX
external	XX
wings	XX
of	XX
the	XX
ANC	XX
and	XX
between	XX
the	XX
newly	XX
freed	XX
leaders	XX
and	XX
those	XX
activists	XX
who	XX
have	XX
emerged	XX
as	XX
leaders	XX
inside	XX
the	XX
country	XX
during	XX
their	XX
imprisonment	XX
.	XX

In	XX
order	XX
to	XX
head	XX
off	XX
any	XX
divisions	XX
,	XX
Mr.	XX
Mandela	XX
,	XX
in	XX
a	XX
meeting	XX
with	XX
his	XX
colleagues	XX
before	XX
they	XX
were	XX
released	XX
,	XX
instructed	XX
them	XX
to	XX
report	XX
to	XX
the	XX
ANC	XX
headquarters	XX
in	XX
Lusaka	XX
as	XX
soon	XX
as	XX
possible	XX
.	XX

The	XX
men	XX
also	XX
will	XX
be	XX
faced	XX
with	XX
bridging	XX
the	XX
generation	XX
gap	XX
between	XX
themselves	XX
and	XX
the	XX
country	XX
's	XX
many	XX
militant	XX
black	XX
youths	XX
,	XX
the	XX
so-called	XX
young	XX
lions	XX
who	XX
are	XX
anxious	XX
to	XX
see	XX
the	XX
old	XX
lions	XX
in	XX
action	XX
.	XX

Says	XX
Peter	XX
Mokaba	XX
,	XX
president	XX
of	XX
the	XX
South	XX
African	XX
Youth	XX
Congress	XX
:	XX
``	XX
We	XX
will	XX
be	XX
expecting	XX
them	XX
to	XX
act	XX
like	XX
leaders	XX

the	XX
ANC	XX

''	XX

They	XX
never	XX
considered	XX
themselves	XX
to	XX
be	XX
anything	XX
else	XX
.	XX

At	XX
last	XX
night	XX
's	XX
rally	XX
,	XX
they	XX
called	XX
on	XX
their	XX
followers	XX
to	XX
be	XX
firm	XX
,	XX
yet	XX
disciplined	XX
,	XX
in	XX
their	XX
opposition	XX
to	XX
apartheid	XX
.	XX

``	XX
We	XX
emphasize	XX
discipline	XX
because	XX
we	XX
know	XX
that	XX
the	XX
government	XX

very	XX

very	XX
sensitive	XX

Andrew	XX
Mlangeni	XX
,	XX
another	XX
early	XX
Umkhonto	XX
leader	XX
who	XX
is	XX
now	XX
63	XX

``	XX
We	XX
want	XX
to	XX
see	XX
Nelson	XX

all	XX
our	XX

out	XX

if	XX
